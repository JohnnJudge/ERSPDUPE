       "  (' Depending on what scale you intend to sell your art pieces, you may want to get an account on an online art community or store, like Deviant Art. With 15% -20\\xa0% brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search).   Read the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales. If your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.  ',\n",

This keeps you on the radar of past customers, which is important. And if it's a really wonderful newsletter, you might get lucky and they might send it to all of their friends as well – then even more eyes are seeing your work!

Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.).   If you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com. Give serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment. Add prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion. When creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.  \",\n",

It's much the same as putting together a company (indeed, you should treat your online art sales as a business) – you will try to make your name known, or at least give people a hint on who you are as an artist, develop your services as you grow, and gain in reputation as time goes on. It may feel like a long time at the beginning but solid and patient foundations will set you up for a good future, as well as maintaining a positive attitude about what you're doing.   Attend as many relevant art shows to show your work as you can. If the shows are juried, display the awards your art has won as part of your profiles or website backgrounds.  \",\n",

       "  (\" Having your own site means that you can optimize every page for search engines and it sets you apart from the many artists who only use general art sales sites. Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.).   If you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com. Give serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment. Add prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion. When creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.  \",\n",

You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.).   If you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com. Give serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment. Add prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion. When creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds.

There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search).   Read the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales. If your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely.

With 15% -20\\xa0% brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search).   Read the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales. If your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.  ',\n",

Be it the few words, Twitter allows you or an entire page of indulgence that your own website would allow you. Bring out the most salient features of your creativity, your experience, your passion, and your reasons for painting. Make it clear to readers why you are an artist who loves art, produces high quality art, and is a true champion of art. If you're not great with words, find a friend who can help you with this really important aspect of selling online – the establishment of your credibility and reliability.;\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Depending on what scale you intend to sell your art pieces, you may want to get an account on an online art community or store, like Deviant Art. With 15% -20\\xa0% brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search).\\n\\n\\nRead the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales.\\nIf your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Get yourself out there as best as you can by advertising yourself. Publish some \"example\" pieces around the web to show what you can do and to demonstrate your style. Be sure to add a watermark to your digital version to protect your artwork from art thieves.\\n\\n\\nSpend a little time researching online the ways in which other artists are promoting themselves. What works for them and what doesn\\'t? What do you like about their promotional strategies and what do you want to avoid? This type of research can give you a lot of ideas and also alert you to potential pitfalls for the ways in which you will promote your own artwork. Bookmark the sites of artists selling online that really inspire you, so that you can come back to them regularly to see how they\\'re evolving and succeeding.\\nSeize the power of Twitter and Facebook to increase people\\'s knowledge of you. Tweet updates about your new paintings, your thoughts about art, and news items about art in general. On Facebook, place photos of your artwork, (digitally watermarked), photos of you receiving awards, and information about your art, artwork in general, and perhaps even some critiques of artwork.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Given the hundreds of free blogging websites, you have a lot of choice in keeping a blog. Most importantly, it\\'s extremely useful to keep it updated regularly - this gives people something \"pretty to look at\", and a story to follow as your reputation increases and your sales story grows. A blog can pick up a lot of hits from search engines if you utilize the keywords feature accurately; use it to your advantage. Be sure to name your blog something simple but memorable – you\\'ll want people to be able to find you with ease.\\n\\n\\nRead How to start a blog and How to increase website traffic for free for assistance.\\nA good way to test keywords for very little cost is through using an auction site. Play around with the words you use to title your art sales, as well as the words used within the body of the text. Keep changing the words until you find the sweet spot – words that really do seem to attract the most views.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" This could be your most effective tool if managed well. For every sale you make, every person who sends you an email that might be interested, get all of their email addresses in digital database ready for mass emailing. At designated intervals (once a month, every other week, whenever you start a new series) send them all nice, grammatically correct, friendly emails, complete with a neatly set-out portfolio of the pictures of your recent work (a PDF can work well for this purpose). This keeps you on the radar of past customers, which is important. And if it's a really wonderful newsletter, you might get lucky and they might send it to all of their friends as well – then even more eyes are seeing your work!\\n\\n\\nEvery thoughtful mailing list includes an opt-out option. Don't be threatened by this; see it as good housekeeping and as retaining the clients who really do want to see your items. You're not online to hassle people who aren't interested!\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Like they say, \"a picture\\'s worth a thousand words\" and you\\'ll want your impression on potential customers to be good. Show detail, right down to paint strokes and paint type. Be willing to show potential buyers multiple shots of your work under different light, hung on a wall, etc. This may be the only way to alleviate the justifiable fear many people have of buying a work of art that they have never seen in person.\\n\\n\\nBear in mind that not everyone has a good internet connection.

       "  \" Having your own site means that you can optimize every page for search engines and it sets you apart from the many artists who only use general art sales sites. Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.).\\n\\n\\nIf you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com.\\nGive serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment.\\nAdd prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion.\\nWhen creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" An online art business needs to be built up little by little. It's much the same as putting together a company (indeed, you should treat your online art sales as a business) – you will try to make your name known, or at least give people a hint on who you are as an artist, develop your services as you grow, and gain in reputation as time goes on. It may feel like a long time at the beginning but solid and patient foundations will set you up for a good future, as well as maintaining a positive attitude about what you're doing.\\n\\n\\nAttend as many relevant art shows to show your work as you can. If the shows are juried, display the awards your art has won as part of your profiles or website backgrounds.\\n\\n\"],\n",

While some people might still know your real name, keeping your real name separate from your stage name can afford you some level of privacy.\\n\\nDifferentiation: If your real name is very common, a stage name can help you stand out and be more memorable.\\n\\nPrejudice considerations: Some people have used stage names in the past in order to decrease immediate reactions of racism, anti-Semitism or other forms of prejudice. Luckily, this is less often the case today. Similarly, some women may have avoided a hyphenated name because it might indicate they’re married, which unfortunately some consider to be detrimental to their careers.;\\n',\n",

Does your stage name suit an older performer just as well as a younger one?\\n\\n\\nChild performers should consider how their names will grow with them as they get older. Joe Yule called himself Mickey Rooney, a good name for a kid actor. But it was less useful as an adult actor.

Often, a large part of what is spent on food is more about entertainment than to provide appropriate nutrition. Instead of making “going out to dinner” a family activity, make cooking dinner together at home the evening's entertainment. Home cooked food is much less expensive and can be a lot more fun! Some entertaining ways to cook at home include:\\n\\n\\nBaking and decorating cookies or a cake with younger children. Kids love to ice and decorate cookies and cakes. Buy plenty of sprinkles, colored icings, and small candies and let them go to work.\\nTeaching older children a family recipe by preparing it together. Many older children are interested in learning how to prepare family favorites, and what better way to learn than by preparing them together?\\nMaking individual or personal pizzas. Using bagels, flour tortillas, French bread, or pizza dough, make a personal size pizza for each family member and allow everyone to top their own pies from a selection of vegetables, cheeses, meats, etc.\\nExperimenting with new things. For example, if you have always been interested in Indian cuisine, use curry in your cooking. Find new ways to prepare favorite vegetables or test out new recipes.

Here's a brief summary of the different methods and their main features that will help you decide:\\n\\n\\n\\nAcid etching method: this method requires extreme safety measure, the availability of many materials such as the etchant and it is somewhat slow. The quality of PCB obtained varies according to the materials you use but generally, it is a good method for simple to intermediate levels of complexity circuits. Circuits involving more close wiring and tiny wires usually use other methods.\\n\\nUV etching method: this method is used for transposition of your PCB layout onto your PCB board and requires more expensive materials that might not be available everywhere. However, the steps are relatively simple and can produce finer and more complicated circuit layouts.\\n\\nMechanical etching/routing method: this method requires special machines that will mechanically etch away unnecessary copper from the board or route empty separators between wires. It can be expensive if you intend to buy one of those machines and usually leasing them requires the availability of a workshop nearby. However, this method is good if you need to create many copies of the circuit and also can produce fine PCBs.\\n\\nLaser etching method: this is usually used by large production companies, but can be found on some universities. The concept is similar to mechanical etching but LASER beams are used to etch the board. It is usually hard to access such machines, but if your local university is one of the lucky ones having such machine, you can use their facilities if they allow it.;\\n\",\n",

They generally appear where the person's body touches the mattress, such as the bottom of the feet, the shoulders, the buttocks, and the back of the head.To combat pressure sores, try to change your parent's position every 2 hours, and encourage them to move their body in the bed as much as possible. You can also find special mattresses and cushions that can help relieve pressure points.\\nPay attention to the sheets. They should be cotton or silk, and you should smooth them out before putting your parent on them, as wrinkled sheets can increase the chance of bed sores.\\nMake sure your parent's skin is moisturized regularly. Also, avoid using scented soaps and talcum powder, as those can dry out the skin. Dry skin makes your parent more susceptible to bed sores. It can also help to make sure your parent is drinking at least 2 liters of fluid a day.\\nOn people with darker skin, you may see blue or purple patches, while the patches will be red or white on lighter-skinned people. Cracks, wrinkles, swelling, shiny areas, blisters, and dry areas are also indicators of bed sores. Talk to a nurse if you start noticing these signs.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' When laying in bed regularly, liquids can build up in the lungs, leading to congestion and even pneumonia. The best way to combat this problem is to make sure your parent is rotated to a new position regularly, preferably every 2 hours.',\n",
       "  \" The emotional side of a illness can be just as destructive as the physical side. When your parent becomes bedridden, they can't do the things they used to or visit with the people they enjoyed seeing regularly.Encourage people to come over and visit with your parent, so they have regular interaction.\\nAlso, try to encourage your parent to still participate in activities they enjoy as much as possible. For instance, if your parent enjoys making art, get them a small set of art supplies they can use in bed with a table.\\nIt's also important to provide a safe place where your parent can talk about what's going on. They need a sounding board as much as you do. You can be this person some of the time, but make sure that your parent feels comfortable talking with other people as well. If you are their only source of support, then this can put a lot of pressure on you when you already have so much going on.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Often, a person who is bedridden will qualify for having a social worker assist with their needs. A social worker can benefit you, too, as they can help you find the care you need for your parent, as well as other resources.Most hospitals have social services on site, though you can also visit a Medicare/Medicaid office in your local community, or visit the offices of an insurance company that that your parent goes through.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' When your parent is sick, you may feel like you\\'re alone in the situation. However, more often than not, friends and family would like to help you, but they don\\'t know how. Take the time to meet with friends and family members one at time to ask for help.It is important to be assertive when asking for help from friends and family. Try saying, \"I\\'m creating a weekly schedule for Mom\\'s care. Please let me know which two days you would like this week.\"\\nOffer a specific task if they don\\'t seem to know how to help.\\nIf you have children, then you might also consider asking a friend or family member to watch them for you one evening per week while you care for your parent. Be sure to let your children know why you need someone to watch them during these times.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" If your parent has become bedridden, it's likely you'll need some help from professional caregivers. If you're caring for the person at home, you can get help from people who come to the house. If the person will need long-term care, you may need to consider placing them in a facility that can provide care. If your parent has a terminal illness, hospice care may provide some relief.Both in-home care and care facilities can be expensive. Insurance and medicare may cover some in-home care (which sometimes includes in-home care at senior facilities).\\nHave a talk with your parent about getting some help. They may not like the idea much, as some people are reluctant to have outside help. If you need help persuading them, try asking someone who's been in a similar situation to help. It might also be hard for your parent to hear this from you. You might consider asking someone who has a different relationship with your parent to talk with them instead, such as a close friend, a cousin, or a spiritual leader.\\nYou can hire whatever level of care you need. For instance, some non-medical care can help with basics like bathroom assistance and meals. However, if your parent needs medical care, you will need to hire nurses or nursing aids to help, though that kind of care is generally prescribed by a doctor.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" When your parent is bedridden, you likely will have a surplus of emotions, which is perfectly normal. You may find you feel anger or resentment. You might feel guilty that you can't spend more time with them or that they're bedridden and you're not. You also may feel anxiety about the situation. Grief is also common, as you've lost who your parent was.Let yourself feel those emotions. Acknowledge them, and give yourself permission to feel them. Also, make sure you find someone to talk to. Anyone with a sympathetic ear will do.Writing down your feelings is also a good way to get them out and understand them better. Try keeping a journal as well.\\nYou can also talk with others who are facing the same issue. You can join a local support group or find one online. In fact, if your parent is on hospice, many hospice organizations have grief support groups available for people in your situation. Just knowing you're not alone can help.\\nProfessional counseling can also be beneficial. If your parent is bedridden, particularly if they have a terminal illness, it can be difficult to come to terms with that, especially if you have a complicated relationship with your parent. A professional can help you work through those feelings and come to terms with what's happening.\",\n",
       "  \" When it comes to a parent's failing health, you may find that having specific answers can somehow make the diagnosis more manageable. When you have questions about your parent's health, ask the doctors and nurses. If you don't understand their answer, ask them to explain it in layperson's terms. You deserve to know what's going on (with your parent's consent, of course).Taking notes or having another person there to help you remember everything during conversations with doctors and nurses can also be helpful. Emotions may be high, which might make it hard for you to remember everything.\\n\\n\",\n",

Whatever it is, take some time each day to do something you enjoy.Similarly, it's important to maintain the relationships in your life. Try to get away to spend time with people you care about, so you can just be you for a while.At the very least, set aside some time each day to return calls, respond to text messages, or check in with your other loved ones.\\nAlso, take time to escape. That is, sometimes, escaping into the fantasy world of a book, movie, or television show can give you the mental break you need. You can even enjoy these with your parent. Listening to your favorite music can also help you take a break.Be sure to schedule this time in. Don’t wait until you feel like you need a break.\\n\\n\",\n",

It is important to explore this dissatisfaction because this is the central aspect of every time we feel unhappy.;\\n\",\n",

Where a meal cooked by yourself or by someone you care for is a different experience.\\nConsider how much money was involved in the experience as this can affect the quality or value. There is a case where a person may hold the view have said that if you don\\'t charge for services, no one will appreciate its value.\\nWhat really happens however is that the cost paid for it dulls the experience, because the money itself has to be earned so it has its own relative cost to us as individuals. It returns to being a commodity as you are paying for it, therefore you have an expectation of your money (or ultimately, your efforts) getting what they are worth, or a return of investment. Both parts actually make quite special things seem very ordinary and unimportant and the experience of quality and sense of value is lost.\\nIt is important to consider however this exercise really is not about expecting people to do things for nothing, for the flipside is that when you value something, you are often more likely to bid higher for it to attain that goal.\\nAdditionally, many needed services just won\\'t exist without money to cover their costs, so the balance is between money making operations, or exploitative and the differences between them.\\nPart of the problem and indeed the solution is this same relative cost and return process.

This has a terrible cost to both sides.\\nThe alternative is when you do something for someone else, or vice versa (without any obligation or expectation, but just out of friendship, kindness or compassion), or share moments with people in a beneficial context it seems so much more precious and these are the memories that people cherish. This is because there is no physical or mental \"cost\" paid, or that the cost had a return of satisfaction.\\nThis is well reflected in people who follow a virtue system, volunteer their time or live a little more frugally within their economic means. The sacrifice of personal time and efforts, or practicing self control against our easier desires gives in effect a return of the investment of effort.\\nThese practitioners typically feel more satisfaction and more frequent satisfaction and so develop a sense of life-quality, but also appreciate things and people wisely and are consequently appreciated and valued by others.

As it is a central part of ordinary human interaction, it can't be avoided without becoming an recluse and that can make us cold and lonely when we shun others.\\nDiving in and sacrificing everything for others may make us vulnerable for the times when things don't go to plan.

As it is an effective method (after all, only until a person realizes they are being exploited will they know), so any extreme response leads into horror or misery, so less quality of life - people are resistant to change from outside, few will understand and even those that do are unlikely to implement difficult change.

       "  ' Depending on the crowd, you are going to want to use different types of music. In some situations you\\'ll want to use hymns like \"Be thou my vision\", in others you\\'ll want to use older songs like \"Every move I make\", in others you\\'ll want brand new songs like \"10,000 reasons\" or \"Our God is Greater\", and in some other situations you will want to combine all three. Generally this has to do with the people within the church and not the type of church it is, so go up to the pastor, worship leader, or some type of leader, and ask them to list off a few songs they normally play and base your song choice off of that.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' If you are playing for someone else who is speaking, which you probably will be, you will want to try to match your songs with the topic of the speaking. For instance, if the speaker is talking about how we should do everything as if we were doing it for Christ, you might want to play \"Every move I make\" or \"Jesus Paid it all\", or anything that is related to the words to be spoken.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" Once you have all the information about the types of songs you want to use, you are going to want to put all options into a list with their keys next to them. If you don't know the keys, look them up online and you should be able to find the key information, and if not, just guess what you think it might be in. Of course, if God told you any specific songs you will want to have those in their as well, even if they don't match the style of the church or the message.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' If you end up having too many songs for the time allotted, you will have to stop early and the set will sound unfinished. If you have too few songs, the set will sound awkward; you may have to fill time by playing again, one of the songs you already played! This is to be avoided at all costs. Find out how many songs you have time for, when you will be playing them, and whether or not they are split up. For example, the venue could tell you that you will be playing eight songs, so you set up those eight songs, but when you get there you find out you are playing four songs before the message and four songs after, which screws up the transitions you made for the 4th and 5th song.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' This is where the keys come in. Find songs that have the same, or close to the same, key. Example a song in B flat and a song in C are close enough together to be considered similar as you can change the key of one or even both of the songs without making any drastic changes. These songs will go together quite well, especially if they are in the same time signature. One thing that really makes worship awkward is when the worship team finishes a song, it becomes completely quiet, and the crowd starts hearing the movement of capos on guitars. you are going to want to make easy transitions, and this means either having the songs in the same key, or similar keys. Once you have the songs that go together, you are ready for the next step.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' While setting up the arrangement, you want to make sure you keep similar songs together, to make smooth transitions. If it\\'s not possible, don\\'t fret, it\\'s not that big of a deal. Once you are completely done with the arrangement of songs, move on to the next step. There are multiple ways to set up a set depending on how many songs you are playing and when you are playing them. You will want to play upbeat songs early, normal songs in the middle, and intimate songs towards the end. If you are playing a lot of songs, six or more, before the message, you will want to start off with upbeat songs that get people on their feet, like \"Sing Sing Sing\" by Chris Tomlin or \"Your Love Never Fails\" by Jesus Culture. Around halfway, get into a normal tempo like \"Better is One Day\", then towards the end drop down to intimate like \"This is The Air I Breathe\", or \"Prepare the Way\". If you are playing fewer songs before the message (four or five) you will want to keep the same structure, but keep it more on the upbeat side throughout. Don\\'t go all the way intimate. If you are playing just a couple songs before the message, (one to three) you will want to keep the same style throughout, preferably upbeat or normal. If you are playing many songs after the message, you will want to start off with an intimate feeling, then halfway through get all the way up to upbeat, then back down to normal or even intimate. If you are playing a few songs after the message, you will want to do the same structure as a lot of songs, but on the intimate side, meaning don\\'t have the upbeat songs. If you are playing just a couple of songs after the message, keep them the same tempo, preferably normal or intimate.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" Now, this whole thing changes a lot when your set is split up like the example above. If you are playing a lot of songs both before and after, play upbeat songs up front, then slow down to more normal songs towards the middle, then speed up right before the message to upbeat. After the message, start off with some really slow intimate songs, speed up to normal, and end with intimate. This is at variance with the prior step. The reason you want to do this is because, if you are playing more than six songs before and after the message, you risk tiring out your crowd's attention span. So you need to mix it up. If you go to see a band play live, notice that they throw in some random really upbeat or really intimate songs so you keep listening, and you want this same thing in worship, because, otherwise, they will stop worshipping. If you are playing a few songs before, start with upbeat and end with normal. The rest of the information is the same as above.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" You want to keep the music flowing from one song to the next, and not have any sudden stops. When the next song is in the same key, keep playing the chord progression on an acoustic guitar very lightly and then change the progression according to the next song and continue. If two adjoining songs aren't in the same key, you can possibly make it sound like they are in the same key, for instance if you are playing a song in C and are changing to a song in G, you can keep playing C and G over and over again as they are in both C key and G key, then change to the G progression and it won't be at all noticeable unless your a musician. Even if there is just one note that's the same within the two keys, you might be able to have your guitarist keep playing that note and then continue in the next key once someone starts playing the new chord progression. Another way is to have the drummer keep playing and then have the rest of the band join in after changing keys. This can sound great if done right. If none of those are possibilities, have someone on your team pray or give a brief message while someone else starts playing the new chords. The audience will pay attention to the voice and not the music.\\n\\n\",\n",

Action begins at the local level, so find opportunities to volunteer around town. In Fascism, what is good for the community is good for the People and the State.\\n\\n',\n",

Instead, Fascism believes in putting together a system where those fit to rule ensure that power stays in the right hands, and so power is passed through a dynastic or oligarchic system.

Instead of class warfare Fascism believes in class collaboration - the different classes must all work together to help strengthen their community and their State.

       " 'How to Avoid Temptation to Sin': [' Everyone has their own temptations. Though Jesus never sinned, even he was tempted to. (Hebrews 4:15) Spend a few moments self-reflecting to identify your personal temptations. Then, pin down the personality traits that lead you to temptation - maybe you\\'re insecure or you\\'re never satisfied with yourself. Perhaps you prioritize pleasure over responsibility. No two people are exactly alike. Your temptations might resemble those of your friends, family, or other associates, but there\\'s also a chance that they\\'re unique to you. A priest, counselor, or other trusted person can help you discover your unique temptations and the flaws from which these temptations developed.\\n\\nIf you\\'re having a hard time defining exactly what your temptations are, begin by pinpointing the things in your life that make you sad, then try to find a thought process or habit you possess that leads to these things. For instance, let\\'s say you\\'re in a committed relationship with a woman you love but you frequently feel intense guilt because you flirt with other women. Search your heart. Ask yourself, \"what do I think or do that makes me want to act like this?\" After some reflection, you may find, for instance, that you\\'re worried about whether you\\'re still attractive. The source of your temptation in this case is your sense of insecurity.;\\n',\n",
       "  ' Your aim when fighting temptation should take into account the fact that, as a human being, you\\'re incapable of perfection. Don\\'t set an un-achievable goal like \"I will never sin again.\" If you do, you\\'re setting yourself up for disappointment. Realize that you will inevitably sin again (and again and again). Set a realistic goal that takes this into account. ]\\n\\n\\nFor instance, if you\\'ve been neglecting your child\\'s vocal recitals in favor of nights spent at home watching TV, you might set a goal of never missing another vocal recital (except for emergencies) and of reducing your time spent watching TV every week by four hours. This goal is well within your grasp.\\nFor a few very serious sins, it is absolutely necessary to set a zero-tolerance goal - for instance, you should obviously never commit murder or marital infidelity. These sins can cause irreparable damage to others\\' lives.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" You were blessed with free will for a reason. Don't waste your opportunity to act decisively against your personal temptation by giving into the separate temptation of inaction! Stand up and take action now. Make it your goal going forward to not give in to your temptation. The hardest part of overcoming your temptation can be getting started. Don't sabotage your journey before it's begun by telling yourself you can't do it.\\n\\n\\nWhen Jesus died, he gave us authority over the forces of evil. (Mark 16:17) Never fear or run from the forces of evil in your own life. With hard work and sincere faith, nothing is beyond your grasp.\\n\\n\",\n",

The only right path is forward, towards righteousness. If your past is marked by sin, acknowledge your mistakes without excessive guilt. Build upon your past mistakes. Strive never to make your old mistakes again. Even if you relapse, you\\'ll have made progress away from your sinful past.\\n\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t already, sincerely ask God for forgiveness. God is infinite in his capacity to forgive. In his eyes, once you are forgiven, it\\'s as if you had never committed sin in the first place: \"And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.\" (Hebrews 10:17)\\n\\n',\n",

If you're frequently persuaded by certain friends to commit acts of vandalism, don't hang out with these friends. By distancing yourself from the people and things associated with your sin, you're eliminating opportunities for sin and giving yourself less chances to fail.\\n\\n\\nGenerally, it's a good idea to help other people work through their own sins. However, if you're struggling with the pull of your own temptations, sinful people can make it difficult to escape. Wait until you have your temptations under control before returning to help these people with their own sins.\\nEliminate the sources of temptation from your home.

Devote yourself to your job or your studies by taking extra hours or signing up to be a tutor, for instance. Spend time learning an instrument or a new language. If you have lots of free time, do anything you can to fill your time with activities that can help you grow closer to God, or that make you a healthier, richer, or better person.\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re struggling to think of things that you can do to occupy your time, a good place to start is at a local homeless shelter, crisis center, or community outreach center.

The more persistently you fight, the better chance you\\'ll have of beating your temptation.\\n\\n\\nNever reward yourself with sinful \"allowances\" or \"breaks.\" Resist the slippery slope of instant gratification. This instant gratification can act deceitfully, causing you to feel that it\\'s not wrong, although it is in God\\'s eyes.\\nTreat your temptations like bad habits that you must break.

It's also inevitable that we will give in to this urge at some point. However, it's possible, through our efforts, to reduce the hold that temptation has over us.

(HCG). In addition, a painless ultrasound exam is used on your abdomen to measure an area on the back of the fetus's neck called the nuchal translucency.\\n\\n\\nAbnormal levels of PAPP-A and HCG typically indicate something unusual with your baby, but not necessarily Down syndrome.\\nThe nuchal translucency screening test measures the amount of fluid that's collected there. Abnormally high amounts of fluid usually indicates a genetic disability, but not just Down syndrome.\\nYour doctor will consider your age (older equals higher risk), the results of the blood test, and the ultrasound images to decide if it's likely your fetus has Down syndrome.\\nJust keep in mind that these types of tests are not done in every instance of pregnancy. However, if you are over 35, then you are at higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome and your doctor may recommend testing.\\n\\n\",\n",

Many dangerous microbes are difficult to grow and cultivate, while still others are fragile and die when exposed to air or light. Know the most common delivery methods for bioterrorism agents (listed below) so that, in the event of an attack, you will be better prepared to protect yourself.\\n\\n\\nFood and water contamination: Certain bioterrorism agents can persist in food and water, especially if consumed unheated. Thoroughly cooking food and boiling water can help kill these pathogens.\\nAnimal transmission: Some animals, especially pests like mosquitoes and ticks, can be vectors for deadly diseases. Keeping pest-control agents (insecticides, etc.) is a smart choice to protect against this dispersal method.\\nPerson-to-person transmission: Diseases like smallpox spread extremely contagiously simply from person-to-person contact. In these cases, physically staying away from infected people (via quarantine, for instance) is the best move.\\nAerosol transmission: In perhaps the most dangerous method of transmission, a few bioterrorism agents (like anthrax) can be converted to a fine mist and spread through the air, where they can drift for miles and cause infection upon inhalation. In this case, closing windows and doors and using a proper gas mask can help prevent infection.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'How to Buy a Toilet': [\" When you flush a standard toilet, the handle pulls up a chain, which raises a flush valve. This flush valve then releases at least two gallons (about 7.5 litres) of water from the tank into the bowl in about three seconds, which triggers the siphon to suck the contents of the bowl down the drain and into a sewer system or septic tank. However, contrary to popular belief, the tank is not the most important part of a toilet's technology. In fact, you could detach the tank from the toilet and pour two gallons of water into the bucket by hand, and the toilet would still flush.;\\n\",\n",
       "  \" This type is the most common type in North America. These toilets use the weight and height of the water in the tank to facilitate a flush. The tank then refills via a small gushing pipe (usually plastic) until a float shuts off the flow. If any water does happen to flow a little higher from gushing, hand-motion inside, or even an earthquake, a narrow overflow tube handles any overflow problems. So, as long as the toilet is functioning properly, no water should spill outside of the porcelain tank. This type is the staple toilet, simple, effective, and durable.The flushing sound for gravity assisted toilets also isn't particularly loud and they are easy to repair. However, if you have a lot of people using your toilet (say, a large family) or are going to be putting a lot of wear on the toilet's flush system, gravity-assisted toilets may not have enough power to flush consistently, after every use.Think about purchasing a standard gravity-assisted toilet if you have a small family or a bathroom that will be getting minimal use.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Unlike gravity assisted, pressure-assisted toilets have an ‘active’ rather than a passive mechanism. This type adds pressure to the force of gravity by supplying more force than the traditional unit. Water displaces air inside a sealed cylindrical tank, usually made of metal or plastic, inside the larger ceramic tank, helping to generate a larger force.However, because the water in the tank is held under pressure, it flushes with greater force, resulting in a loud flushing sound. As well, a greater amount of pressure via your toilet can put stress on older pipes and plumbing in your home, which can lead to a leak or a busted pipe.Go for a pressure-assisted toilet if you live in a newer building or a home with new, well kept pipes, and low water pressure.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" This type innovates on the standard gravity-assisted toilet by using a vacuum that draws the water with more force into the bowl using the rim holes in the upper toilet bowl. Vacuum-assisted toilets have a cleaner, quieter flush than other models, making them ideal for a bathroom near your bedroom, or by a quiet area of your home. However, unclogging this type of toilet requires some time and skill. To unplug the bowl, you have to take the lid off and put your hand over an opening in the tank for the plunging action to work. The vacuum-assisted toilet also costs about $100 more than a gravity toilet.\\n\\n\\nThink about getting this type if you're looking for a toilet with quiet but powerful flushing, and are willing to spend some extra money up front.\\n\\n\",\n",

Power-assisted toilets can also save the average family 2,000 gallons of water per year. However, these toilets have a pump that must be plugged into a power outlet, they are known for their incredibly loud flushing sound and they are currently the most expensive type of toilet on the market.Think about purchasing a power-assisted toilet if you\\'re in need of a model with a super powerful flush, regardless of upkeep or cost.\\n\\n',\n",

In fact, studies have shown that a dual-flush toilet uses an average of just 6.9 gallons per day, compared to 9.5 gallons of a low-flow toilet and 19 gallons with the older models. This type can save a household 2,250 gallons of water per a year, and because there are two flushing options, you have the choice between a lighter sounding flush and a louder sounding flush.However, this type has a high up front price tag, and high installation costs.\\n\\n\\nGo for a dual flush toilet if you're looking for an eco friendly, option friendly toilet.

This is a very common mistake made by most of us because we are led to believe that a pillow allows for a more comfortable night's sleep so, through habit, we become attached and generally accept this as the most comfortable way to sleep. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The use of a pillow is an incorrect form of sleeping and should be avoided. While lying on your back with your head resting on a pillow, your neck is bent forward in a very unnatural position. In this position, your head is being pushed forward and your back is arched, also a very unnatural position. If you suffer from frequent neck or back pains, in the majority of cases you can probably blame in your pillow or mattress.\\nMake sure your mattress is firm and capable of giving your body full support. This is aid to in keeping you spine as straight as possible while sleeping. A soft or sagging mattress will tend to bend the spine and curve the torso in a sinking effect, which must be avoided. A good mattress will support the whole body, which will keep in a straight posture setting - a must for obtaining greater height. \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Take a supplement targeted at your age group with breakfast each morning, and try to incorporate certain foods into your diet. Here are some specific suggestions:\\n\\n\\nMake sure to take in an abundance of carbohydrates and calories for that is where the body gains its energy to grow.\\nGet plenty of calcium (found in dairy products and green vegetables). Calcium promotes bone growth and can help prevent osteoporosis.\\nTaking 500 mg of niacin has shown to significantly increase growth hormone levels only when taken on an empty stomach.\\nGet sufficient vitamin D (which can be obtained through eating fish, alfalfa, or mushrooms, or spending enough time in the sun). Vitamin D promotes bone and muscle growth in children, and a deficiency has been shown to stunt growth and cause weight gain in teenage girls. If you don't like fish, consider a purified fish oil supplement (purifying removes mercury).\\nTake in a lots of lean protein (from meat, cheese, eggs, beans, tofu, seeds, or legumes). Proteins provide an essential building block your body needs in order to grow. At least one (preferably two) of your meals each day should include a high-quality protein.\\nIf you think that the amount of protein in your diet is low then take protein powder once or twice a day.\\nUp your zinc intake (oysters, chocolate, peanuts, eggs, peas, asparagus, and supplements). A zinc deficiency can cause stunted growth in children . The best way to make sure you meet your body's daily need is by taking a vitamin or supplement that includes zinc.\\nEat on a regular schedule. You should be eating 3 meals a day, with small snacks between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner. Try to schedule these events at roughly the same time each day. 4-5 hours is the time needed for insulin to disappear from your bloodstream so that growth hormone can work on building your tissue. This is the period of time that you should wait between meals. Proteins, which are absorbed slowly, should keep you from becoming hungry. Your last meal should be 3-4 hours before you go to sleep. Small amount of protein shake are allowed right before your bedtime.\\nEat a steady amount of food. That's why dieting is not recommended as long as you're still growing. Not eating a good quantity of food will deprive your body of the substances detailed above, therefore stunting your growth. If you want to lose weight, decrease the amount of fats, sugar, and carbohydrates from your alimentation\\xa0, but eat the rest of the foods in good, moderate amounts. Also, try losing weight through sports. After all, you can still lose weight later, but you must take the most out of your adolescence if you want to grow taller.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Try to avoid processed foods, foods with empty calories or high levels of fat, and hydrogenated foods, such as margarine or shortening.\\nEat a wide variety of healthy foods. Eating one thing such as açaí berries or salmon for every meal, while not harmful, doesn't do all that much to keep your immune system at its strongest. Eat a variety of fruits, plenty vegetables, whole grains, protein sources such as milk, cheese, nuts and fish, and other foods rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids for a healthier immune system.

Stretching is the most effective form of exercising when it comes to height increase. Doing intense stretching exercises can add a few extra inches to your height, even short after growth has stopped. For best results, you should do these exercise two times a day, after you wake up and before you go to bed.

Being the high-volume filters that they are, the kidneys need adequate water to remove toxins, waste products and unwanted or unneeded compounds from the blood. As such, drinking plenty of water at regular intervals throughout the day will help your kidneys function properly and not get too congested or calcified.Aim for four to six 8-ounce glasses of water a day if you're sedentary, or eight glasses if you're more active or live in a warm climate.During hot summer months or when exercising strenuously, you need to drink more water than usual to make up for fluid lost by perspiring.\\nYour urine should be fairly clear or straw-colored when you go to the bathroom. If it's any darker than that, then it may be a sign you are dehydrated.\\nCaffeinated beverages (coffee, black tea, soda pop) obviously contain water, but caffeine is diuretic and triggers frequent urination, so they are not great sources of hydration. Stick with filtered water and natural fruit/veggie juices.;\\n\",\n",

Hypertension often has no obvious symptoms, so you need to keep on eye on your numbers.\\nEating a low-salt diet, reducing stress and maintaining a healthy weight all help maintain normal blood pressure.\\nIf lifestyle changes don't make a big impact, then blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be able to protect your kidneys by reducing your blood pressure.\\n\\n\",\n",

Start by simply walking around your neighborhood (if it's safe), then transition to more challenging terrain with some hills. Treadmills and cycling are also great for cardiovascular exercise.\\n\\n\\nAvoid vigorous exercise to start with, especially if you've been diagnosed with a heart issue.

In the second trimester it is recommended to eat approximately 340 calories above your normal amount (pre-pregnancy), and in the third trimester 452 calories above your normal amount (pre-pregnancy).Know, however, that these values are averages and there will be slight differences from woman to woman, depending on her pre-pregnancy weight as well as her general health and metabolism.\\n\\n',\n",

In addition, one to two pounds will make up the placenta, one to two pounds will be amniotic fluid, one or so pounds will be breast tissue, two or so pounds will be due to a larger uterus, two to three pounds in extra fluid stored in your body, and two to three extra pounds will be from a larger blood supply.By the end of pregnancy, the average woman is 27 or 28 pounds heavier than she was prior to pregnancy.',\n",

The current medical guidelines suggest a diet comprised of 20% protein, 30% fat, and 50% carbohydrates.To break it down based on the food pyramid, an example of a healthy diet during pregnancy would look as follows: 6-11 servings of grains, 3-5 servings of vegetables, 2-4 servings of fruit, 3-4 servings of dairy, and 2-3 servings of meats, beans, or nuts.Note that whole grains (and non-refined sources of carbohydrates) are a better choice, especially when it comes to keeping your blood sugars in a healthy range.\\n\\n\"],\n",
       " 'How to Find out if the Child Is Really His': [\" If you're pregnant and you're unsure about who the father is, it is possible to determine paternity before the child is born. Several tests can obtain a DNA sample from the baby while it's in utero. Note, however, that with these methods, you will need the father to provide a DNA sample (usually via cheek swab or blood sample.) Of all the prenatal options for paternity testing, Non-Invasive Prenatal Paternity (NIPP) Testing is the least stressful for the baby. This test doesn't take a DNA sample directly from the unborn baby. Rather, it takes a blood sample from the mother. The baby's DNA, which can be found in the mother's bloodstream, is analyzed and compared to the potential father's.\",\n",
       "  \" Other options for determining a baby's paternity besides NIPP Testing exist. However, because some of these procedures require a doctor to enter the uterus with medical devices, they carry small but real risks up to and including miscarriage. Because of this, deciding to undergo an invasive paternity test is a serious decision that shouldn't be made lightly. Talk to your doctor before deciding on an invasive paternity testing procedure - even the smallest risks should be taken into account for the sake of the baby's health.\\n\\n\\nAmniocentesis. This test is usually performed in the second trimester, between the 14th and 20th week of pregnancy. The doctor uses an ultrasound device to guide a thin needle into the uterus through the abdomen. The needle draws a small amount of amniotic fluid, which is tested.\\n\\nAccording to the American Pregnancy Association, side effects of this procedure include cramping, amniotic fluid leak, and vaginal bleeding. There is a small risk of miscarriage (about 1 in 300-500). A doctor's consent is needed to do this procedure.\\n\\n\\nChorionic Villus Sampling. This test is similar to Amniocentesis in that a needle is inserted into the vagina guided by ultrasound to obtain a sample of a chorionic villi. The chorionic villi are finger like structures attached at the wall of the uterus which comes from the same fertilized egg as the fetus hence will have the same genetic make up. This test can be done earlier in pregnancy (from 10-13 weeks on).\\n\\nLike with Amniocentesis, a doctor's consent is needed to do this procedure. Similarly, there is also a very small (but real) risk of miscarriage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" If the baby is about to be born, you may not want to perform a prenatal test. In this case, know that it's possible to obtain a DNA sample from a recently-born baby. Usually, this means taking a blood sample from the umbilical cord just after the baby is born. This doesn't hurt the baby - the cord has no feeling.\\n\\n\\nGenerally, umbilical cord tests are less expensive than prenatal tests, but more expensive than postnatal tests (tests performed after birth from a cheek swab, blood sample, etc.).\",\n",
       "  \" DNA tests can be performed on people of any age. If your child has already been born, there are a wide variety of accredited labs which, for a fee, can perform a paternity test with a high level of accuracy using a DNA sample from the child, the father, and, occasionally, the mother. Search online for paternity testing agencies to learn more. Before you make a decision, make sure that the DNA Diagnostic center you use is properly accredited by the AABB, the American Association of Blood Banks.\\n\\n\\nIf the DNA samples are taken in a clinical setting, they will most likely be in the form of a cheek swab or with a blood sample.\\nPaternity tests don't necessarily need a clinical cheek swab or blood sample from the father - it's possible (but not usually guaranteed) that a usable DNA sample can be obtained from such things as a strand of hair, a piece of chewing gum, a cigarette butt, and other discarded items.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" After DNA samples have been taken, they must be sent to a lab and analyzed by technicians to determine the child's paternity. Allow several days to about weeks for your results. Talk to your test provider - the results may be mailed to you, or you may have to go back to the testing location to receive them.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" Understand that, in most circumstances, paternity testing is considered an elective (non-necessary) procedure, so it's not covered by most insurance plans.Tests can range anywhere from less than $100 (for the cheapest options) to $1000 to $2,000 for the most accurate, extensive testing. Prenatal tests are almost always more expensive than postnatal tests. For accurate results, you should expect to pay at least several hundred dollars.Note that if you want the results of a DNA test to be admissible in court, the price will likely be higher. If you just want the result for personal knowledge, however, the price will likely be lower, and the test can be self-administered at home.Sometimes, there is a separate fee for DNA sample collection.\\n\\n\"],\n",

       " 'How to Prevent Acid Reflux During Pregnancy': [\" Another recommendation for combating heartburn is to eat smaller portions of food spaced out through the day. Eating smaller meals every few hours instead of three large meals many hours apart prevents your stomach from becoming too full and putting pressure under your diaphragm and pushing acid up into your esophagus.As such, switch to eating 5-6 small meals or snacks daily spaced about 2 hours apart.\\n\\n\\nYour last meal or snack of the day should be eaten early in the evening, at least 3 hours before you head to bed. This gives your stomach enough time to properly digest the food and send it on to your small intestine.\\nAim for small meals or snacks that are around 300 to 400 calories each. Gaining some weight during pregnancy is necessary as you're eating for two, but significant weight gain increases your risk of diabetes.;\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Slow down when you eat your meals or snacks and chew each mouthful thoroughly before swallowing because it promotes better digestion.Conversely, eating too quickly and not chewing properly reduces the amount of saliva release into your mouth and causes your stomach to work harder, which increases the likelihood of indigestion and heartburn. Eating slowly also tends to prevent over-eating because you feel full quicker.\\n\\n\\nTake small bites and chew each mouthful of food for between 20-30 seconds so that there\\'s lots of saliva in your mouth before swallowing.\\nChewing your food well reduces the need to drink lots of liquids with meals in order to \"flush the food down.\" Drinking more than a few ounces of liquid with meals can dilute digestive enzymes and promote indigestion.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Chewing gum can help provide relief from heartburn because it stimulates the production of saliva, which contains acid-neutralizing bicarbonate.Swallowing more saliva can literally \"put the fire out\" because it neutralizes the stomach acid that\\'s gotten into the esophagus. In this sense, saliva is your body\\'s natural antacid.\\n\\n\\nAvoid minty and menthol-flavored gum, such as peppermint, because they can actually stimulate your stomach\\'s production of digestive juice.\\nChoose sugar-free gum with xylitol because the artificial sweetener can kill cavity-causing bacteria in your mouth and ulcer-causing bacteria in your stomach.\\nWait about 15-30 minutes after meals before chewing on gum because food needs an acidic environment to be properly digested and broken down.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" Your stomach needs to be very acidic in order to properly digest food, but the problems start when too much acid is produced or if the acid gets past the esophageal sphincter to irritate the esophagus. As such, wait about an hour or so after a meal before drinking a small glass of milk. The minerals in milk (mainly calcium) can neutralize any acid in your esophagus and help to soothe any irritation.\\n\\n\\nUse low-fat milk so that the animal-based fat doesn't make the acid reflux worse.\\nSometimes the sugar (lactose) in milk and other dairy products can trigger heartburn, so experiment with the milk drinking, but stop it if it creates more problems.\\nDon't drink milk after meals if you are lactose intolerant (don't produce enough lactase enzyme) because the symptoms of bloating and cramps can make your acid reflux worse.\",\n",
       "  \" While eating food it's best to sit up straight, but resist the urge to lie down after you finish your meal.Keeping upright works with gravity and promotes the travel of digested food down through your gastrointestinal system. Lying on a couch cancels out the effect of gravity and allows partially digested food and stomach acid to leak through the esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus.\\n\\n\\nIt's the irritation of the lining of the esophagus that causes the burning feeling in your chest — aka heartburn. Other symptoms of acid reflux include: sore throat, difficulty swallowing, dry cough and hoarseness.Wait for at least a few hours before lying down on a couch / bed. You can sit down and put your feet up to rest, but make sure your upper body is erect.\\nAvoid eating big meals to reduce your tiredness (and desire to lie down) due to the sudden secretion of lots of insulin hormone into your bloodstream from your pancreas.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Moderate-to-heavy exercise immediately after a meal greatly increases your risk of indigestion and heartburn, but mild exercise (walking) can help promote intestinal motility — push undigested food and waste material through your intestines so nothing gets backed up.After you finish cleaning up the dishes, go for a 15-20 minute gentle walk or do some light chores around the house.\\n\\n\\nToo much exercise diverts blood away from your gastrointestinal system and into muscles of your legs and arms, which compromises digestion.\\nFocus on doing more exercise during the day instead of at night so that it doesn\\'t affect your sleep.\\nMild exercise promotes regular bowel movements, which prevents a \"log jam\" in your intestines and a build up of pressure from gas.\\n\\n',\n",

To combat heartburn, try elevating your upper body and head with pillows, which will put gravity to work — although pillows may not always be effective because they're too soft.If this isn't comfortable, then lie on your left side, which makes it more difficult for stomach acid to reflux into your esophagus.Foam wedges meant to prop up your upper body in bed are available at some pharmacies and most medical supply stores.\\nAvoid lying on your side while your upper body is propped up by pillow or a wedge because you can irritate your upper spine (mid back) and ribs.\\n\\n\",\n",

Take them about 30-60 minutes after a meal or snack.\\n\\n\\nAntacids don't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by digestive acid, so use them for symptomatic relief only.\\nSome antacids are combined with compounds called alginates, which work by forming a foam barrier in your stomach to prevent acid reflux.\\nOveruse of antacids can trigger diarrhea or constipation, so be cautious and don't take them more than 3 times per day.\\n\\n\",\n",

All home pregnancy tests work the same way - by detecting levels of the hormone hCG in your urine. When purchasing a pregnancy test, check the expiration date on the box and ensure the box is fully intact, with no wear and tear, as this could affect your result. Think about getting a brand that provides two test sticks in the box, especially if you're planning on testing early. This way you can wait a week before trying again, if you get a negative result first time round.Some experts advocate buying a pregnancy test from a large store that has a high turnover so that you are more likely to get a newer pregnancy test, rather than one that has been sitting on a shelf for months. Similarly, if you've had a pregnancy test lying around at home for several months, consider throwing it out and getting a new one, especially if you've been storing it somewhere warm or prone to dampness, as this can affect the results of the test.Some brands claim that they can accurately detect pregnancy on the day of your missed period or even earlier. While it's true that the the tests may be sensitive enough to pick up on higher hCG levels in your urine, it may be too early in your pregnancy for your body to actually produce higher levels of hCG. In this case, you run the risk of getting a negative result, even though you might indeed be pregnant.Many of the generic brand drugstore pregnancy tests are actually produced in the same factories as the big name brands, and use the same technology. So don't worry about the quality of the generic brands if you're trying to save some dollars.;\\n\",\n",

This can be tough when you are anxious to find out if you're pregnant, but waiting allows for a higher degree of accuracy when taking the test, as hCG levels rise rapidly in pregnant women.hCG develops in a woman's body only after a fertilized egg implants in her uterus. Implantation of the fertilized egg typically occurs on or around the 6th day after the sperm and egg have merged. This is why home pregnancy tests won't pick up on any hCG if you take the test too early, even if you are pregnant.It's best to do the home pregnancy test first thing in the morning, when your urine is most concentrated and hCG levels are highest.\",\n",

       " 'How to Understand Morning Sickness': ['\\n\\n\\nIf you’re in the throes of being sick, hearing from your doctor that the sickness you’re experiencing is a positive thing might not be very comforting. But studies have shown that morning sickness often bodes towards a healthy pregnancy, with lower rates of miscarriages and stillbirths, compared to pregnancies with no nausea or vomiting.\\nThat doesn’t mean, however, that those women who experience no nausea in the early months of pregnancy should panic about being more likely to miscarry. A large percentage of them will go on to have perfectly normal pregnancies and births.;\\n',\n",
       "  ' Despite many studies on this subject, scientists have found themselves unable to agree on one specific factor that causes morning sickness. They have, however, isolated several possible causes:\\n\\n\\nHormonal changes may be the cause. Levels of estrogen and progesterone increase rapidly in pregnancy, so some experts have linked this rise to the incidence of morning sickness. Progesterone, in particular, can relax the muscles of the stomach and intestine, resulting in excess stomach acids and reflux. The hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is also a prime suspect, because hCG levels tend to peak around the same time as the nausea, although no one has been able to prove the link between the two. However, women pregnant with twins and multiples tend to have higher levels of hCG, and also experience more severe morning sickness.\\nFluctuating blood sugar levels may cause it. The placenta’s job is to drain the mother’s body of whatever energy and nutrients are required for the fetus to grow and thrive. This can sometimes result in a state of mild hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) which some experts have linked to feelings of nausea.\\nEnhanced sensitivity to smell could also cause morning sickness. It is commonly acknowledged that pregnant women develop an enhanced sense of smell and a sensitivity to odors, even those emanating from far away. It is thought that these smells can over-stimulate the normal nausea triggers in the body, and even set off the gag reflex.\\nInstinctive protective reflexes may also cause the condition. That fact that morning sickness does not affect every healthy pregnancy has led scientists to debate hotly over whether it is a factor in ensuring a normal, healthy baby or if it could just be an unwelcome side effect of the natural processes taking place within the mother’s body. If that was the case, it should be apparent in all successful pregnancies. Also, morning sickness does not seem to occur in other mammals, even though the reproductive system is inherently similar.\\nScientists who analyzed the triggers for nausea found that it is often felt in response to the sight, smell or taste of meat or strong-tasting vegetables – foods that historically were likely to contain food-borne microbes or chemicals that could induce birth defects. Substances like alcohol and cigarette smoke are also common culprits – even evoking negative responses from regular smokers or drinkers.\\nMorning sickness may actually be a kind of evolutionary protective mechanism, designed to keep mothers away from things that may be dangerous to their developing babies. If a woman with morning sickness does not feel like eating foods like poultry, meat or eggs (food which may potentially carry contamination) and instead favors low-risk foods like rice, bread and crackers, she unconsciously improves the chances of survival for her unborn child.\\nWomen experiencing morning sickness usually report a peak in symptoms between week six and week eighteen of pregnancy, the precise period when embryonic organ development is most susceptible to chemical disruption.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Even if you know your morning sickness is a sign that your baby is developing normally and your pregnancy is a healthy one, it can still be hard to deal with. Here are some quick tips to help you combat the symptoms:\\n\\n\\nEat small, frequent meals throughout the day so your stomach is never empty.\\nAvoid foods that trigger nausea and stick to those you can eat. It’s okay if your diet is temporarily a little unbalanced – getting some nutrition is better than none.\\nTry to stay away from heavy, rich, spicy and deep-fried foods, which can irritate your stomach.\\nCarry simple snacks like crackers or cereal bars with you at all times to avoid dips in blood sugar levels.\\nKeep a small snack next to the bed so if you wake in the night, you have something to nibble on – this may help alleviate the first wave of nausea that hits in the morning.\\nEnsure you stay hydrated by sipping on water or juice between meals. If you’ve been vomiting a lot, try a sports drink that will replace the sugars and salts you have lost.\\nTry to rest as much as possible, as tiredness can exacerbate the feeling of sickness.\\nTry ginger ale or ginger tea – ginger is said to settle the stomach and help ease nausea. Keeping a couple of ginger biscuits by the bed to eat as soon as you wake up (before you get up) can also help. Or ask your healthcare provider to recommend a ginger supplement.\\nConsider trying acupressure, which involves wearing bands on your forearms to apply pressure to specific points, said to relieve symptoms of morning sickness.\\n\\n'],\n",

Too much pressure in these veins can lead to swollen or dilated blood vessels, which manifest as hemorrhoids. Pregnant women are more susceptible to hemorrhoids for a variety of reasons:\\n\\n\\nAs you progress through your pregnancy, your growing uterus puts more and more pressure on the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava (a large vein which receives blood from the lower body). This slows blood flow from these veins, leading to increased pressure, and therefore hemorrhoids.\\nPregnant women are also more like to experience constipation. When you strain to pass a hard bowel movement, you put excess pressure on your rectal area. This can lead to the formation of hemorrhoids or exacerbate existing ones.\\nPregnant women also have a higher level of a hormone known as progesterone in their systems.

Shettles recommends charting the cervical mucus for at least a month prior to conception.\\nTake your temperature each morning before you get out of bed. Just after ovulation, your temperature will spike.Because you will want to have sex as close to ovulation as possible, it is advised to chart your BBT at least 2 months prior to conception to get a sense for when your ovulation is likely to occur in the following month.\\nUse an ovulation predictor kit. These kits, which are available at most pharmacies or through online suppliers, detect when your body releases luteinizing hormone (LH) prior to ovulation. To catch the LH surge as soon as possible, Shettles recommends testing twice a day, preferably between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. for the first test and between 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. for the second test.;\\n\",\n",
       "  \" The Shettles Method recommends that the father should takes steps to ensure that his sperm count is as high as possible to raise the chance of a successful pregnancy from a single session of sex. Most importantly, this means that the father should abstain from orgasm for about 2-5 days before ovulation. However, a variety of other factors can also affect sperm count. The tips below can help you get a high sperm count and ensure the sperm are as healthy as possible:\\n\\n\\nKeep the testes cool. Sperm production is at its highest when the testes are slightly cooler than body temperature. Avoid tight-fitting underwear, hot tubs, and warm laptops.\\nDon't smoke or drink. Men who smoke and drink heavily are more likely to have low sperm count. If you're having a hard time quitting, talk to your doctor.\\nDon't take illegal drugs. Marijuana has been shown to have a similar effect as cigarettes when it comes to sperm count. Cocaine and other types of hard drugs are also known to hamper sperm production.\\nAvoid certain medications. A variety of medications can affect a man's fertility — some, like chemotherapy medications, can even make a man permanently infertile.If you are currently taking serious medications, talk to your doctor about your fertility goals. You may be encouraged to make and store a sperm sample to ensure that you'll be able to conceive in the future.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' When the woman is sure that she is ovulating, the couple should have sex. In general, aim to have sex in the narrow window starting 24 hours before ovulation and ending 12 hours after ovulation. During this time, according to the Shettles Method, conceiving a boy is more likely.\\n\\n\\nThe Shettles Method operates under the assumption that, under perfect conditions, male sperm, which are small and fast, but fragile, can reach the egg faster than female sperm which are large and slow, but strong. According to the Shettles Method, the reason that additional children are conceived in a 50:50 ratio normally is that some fragile male sperm die in the birth canal. By having sex as close to ovulation as possible, you ensure that sperm can reach the egg basically immediately, rather than having to wait, which (allegedly) ensures as many male sperm remain alive as possible.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' The Shettles Method advises using sexual positions that encourage deep penetration, such as a rear-entry position, when trying to conceive a boy. The logic behind this is that ejaculating during deep-penetration sex places the sperm as close as possible to the cervix, giving the fast-moving male sperm an advantage. On the other hand, with shallow penetration, sperm may be deposited farther from the cervix, which means that the more durable female sperm (which can survive longer in the vagina) may have the advantage.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" According to the Shettles method, male sperm, which are more fragile than female sperm, tend to die faster in the acidic environment inside the vagina. With this logic, giving the woman an orgasm can improve the chances of the male sperm. During female orgasm, extra cervical fluid is released, decreasing the acidity inside the vagina. This makes the environment more hospitable to male sperm, increasing the chances that they make it to the egg alive. Preferably, the woman's orgasm is achieved immediately before the father ejaculates.\\n\\n\\nThe Shettles Method also claims that the orgasmic contractions can help push the sperm into the cervix faster.\\nIf the woman can't achieve orgasm, don't be discouraged — it's not essential.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" The Shettles Method only claims to work for the single session of sex that you use it during. Any other sex can interfere with the method by causing a child to be conceived outside of ideal Shettles Method conditions during which the chance for conceiving a boy is 50/50. Because of this, it's very important to ensure that the man does not have unprotected sex with the woman in the days before and after ovulation. You don't want the carefully-controlled sperm from your Shettles Method sex session competing with ordinary sperm.\\n\\n\\nBy most measures, sperm can remain alive in the vagina for 3-5 days.This means that the father and mother should stop having unprotected sex about 5 days before ovulation is expected. It's also wise to refrain for several days after ovulation as well for the same reason.\\nIf sex is unavoidable, use a condom to avoid accidentally conceiving a child outside of the predetermined window.\\n\\n\",\n",

Multiple studies have suggested that scientific data partially or totally disproves the Shettles Method.Other studies have shown that attempting sex selection through intercourse timing can reduce your chances of having any child, let alone a boy.In short, it is safe to say that if you attempt to have a boy with the Shettles Method, your results are far from guaranteed.\\n\\n\\nNote that even research that does suggest that the Shettles method can affect the rate of male/female conception pins the effectiveness of the method significantly below the level claimed — on the order of 60%, rather than 80%.\\n\\n\"],\n",

IVF involves five main steps: ovulation induction, egg retrieval, sperm retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer. One cycle of IVF will take about two weeks and you may require more than one cycle to conceive. The process of receiving IVF involves three phases:Phase 1: You will be given fertility shots to increase follicle production and stop your ovulation. You will have multiple visits to your doctor for blood tests and vaginal ultrasounds.\\nPhase 2: Once the eggs mature, there is minor surgery to retrieve them. An embryologist will prepare the eggs and place them in a petri dish. The sperm is then introduced by injecting a single sperm into each egg.\\nPhase 3: After the eggs are fertilized, the eggs’ cells continue to divide until Day 3 or Day 5, when the embryos are transferred. The embryos are screened for disabilities such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, and Down syndrome, if desired. You will then need to decide how many embryos you would like to transfer to your uterus, and if you would like the remaining embryos to be frozen.\\nKeep in mind the possibility of conceiving via IVF cannot be predicted, as each couple has possible factors, such as age and reproductive health, that can affect the success of the treatment. Your doctor should be able to give you a sense of the likelihood of pregnancy for you, based on your background and medical history.

It can also be stressful and mentally draining, especially if you and your partner are struggling to conceive and have to go through several cycles of IVF before getting pregnant. Stress and anxiety can become big risks during the IVF process. There are several medical risks when you use IVF, including:Multiple births: IVF increases your risk of multiple births if more than one embryo is implanted in your uterus. If you become pregnant with multiple babies, you may have a higher risk of early labor.\\nA premature delivery and a low birth weight.\\nOvarian hyperstimulation syndrome: This occurs when your ovaries become swollen and painful. This syndrome can occur due to the use of injectable fertility drugs. You may experience symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you become pregnant, you may experience these symptoms for several weeks.\\nA miscarriage: Though the rate of miscarriage for women who conceive using IVF is similar to that of women who conceive naturally, the rate can increase as the age of the mother increases. Using frozen embryos during IVF has been known to slightly increase the risk of a miscarriage. Complications during the egg-retrieval procedure: The doctor will need to use an aspirating needle to the collect the eggs and this could cause bleeding, infection, or damage to your bowels, bladder, or a blood vessel.\\nAn ectopic pregnancy: This occurs when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube.

If you wish to use this method, your first step is to find and contact a clinic licensed to perform the Ericsson method.\\n\\n\\nA list of Ericsson-licensed clinics can be found on the website of Gametrics Ltd., a company founded by the method's developer and lead proponent, Dr. Ronald Ericsson.

       "  ' Once the father provides his sperm sample, the sperm is placed in a vial of a type of protein called albumin. Sperm can swim through albumin, but the Ericsson method assumes that male sperm, which are smaller, weaker, and faster than female sperm, can pass through the albumin quicker. This means that, after waiting for the sperm to swim from the top of the vial to the bottom of the vial, the sperm near the bottom will (supposedly) be mostly male, while the sperm near the top will be mostly female.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the effectiveness of this process has been called into question many times.Some studies have found that albumin produces no noticeable separation of male and female sperm. Other studies (whose results have sometimes been called into question) purport about a 75% success rate.',\n",

The second half of your cycle causes a surge of progesterone. This hormone leads to a sudden increase in body temperature as it gets your uterus ready for fertilization and implantation. These days where you see a spike in your body temperature are the days when you are most fertile.\\nThe changes in temperature can range from 0.2° to 0.5° C (0.4° to 1.0° F).\\nYou can keep track of your temperature by creating a physical chart.

In fact, it is a myth that a woman can get pregnant throughout her entire menstrual cycle. Instead, you can only get pregnant on your most fertile days, before and during ovulation. Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from your ovary, and moves down your fallopian tube so it can be fertilized by the sperm. The phases of your menstrual cycle are:Menstruation, which begins your menstrual cycle.It happens when your body eliminates the thickened lining of your uterus from your body through the vagina. This causes bleeding during your period, and generally lasts between 3-7 days. It also marks the first day of the follicular phase, which stimulates the growth of follicles, which contain eggs. This phase ends when ovulation occurs. The follicular phase usually lasts 13-14 days, but it can range between 11-21 days.\\nThe ovulatory phase happens when the level of luteinizing hormone rises dramatically. This stimulates the release of an egg. This phase is short, usually lasting only about 16-32 hours, and ends when the body releases the egg.The luteal phase begins after ovulation and continues until the beginning of your next period. It prepares your uterus in case an egg becomes fertilized and implants in the uterine wall. This phase usually starts around 14 days into your cycle and lasts about 14 days.;\\n',\n",

Most women will experience a body temperature shift about half a degree 24 to 48 hours after ovulation. You can use a regular thermometer or buy a special basal body temperature thermometer.\\nGet an ovulation predictor kit. Look for an ovulation predictor kit at your local drugstore. Though it is a more expensive option that tracking your temperature, it may be a more accurate way of pinpointing when you are ovulating. This kit will test your urine to determine the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. You will need to urinate on tester sticks to find out when your LH levels are rising. This is a sign that one of your ovaries is about to release an egg, or that you are about to ovulate.\\nLook for changes in your cervical mucus. During the time in your cycle before ovulation, your body will produce large quantities of thin, clear cervical mucus. This substance smooths the way for the sperm to meet the egg. Right before you start ovulating, you may notice mucus on your underwear or around your vagina. It will appear clear, stretchy, and slippery, like raw egg whites. You can collect a sample of your cervical mucus by gently wiping your vaginal opening with a piece of tissue or a clean finger.

Certain factors increase a woman’s likelihood of experiencing an ectopic pregnancy.\\n\\n\\nGenerally, women who have had an ectopic pregnancy in the past are more likely to experience such pregnancies in the future too.Other risk factors include: pelvic infections (sexually transmitted infections), multiple sexual partners (as this increases the chance of unknown STI\\'s), fallopian tube tumors or abnormalities, previous abdominal or pelvic surgery, having an IUD, endometriosis, or smoking.Also, if a woman has had \"sterilization\" (also known a \"tubal ligation\" surgery, when her \"tubes are tied\" in an effort to prevent future pregnancy), although this is normally very successful in preventing pregnancy if one were to become pregnant the risk of it being an ectopic pregnancy is notably higher.',\n",
       "  ' This is the first step towards the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy.β-HCG is a hormone that is secreted by the developing embryo and placenta, so it rises as the pregnancy progresses and is a more definitive (and reliable) form of pregnancy test.\\nIf the β-HCG level is above 1500 IU/L (often between 1500-2000 IU/L is suspicious), but no pregnancy is seen with ultrasound, doctors will worry about you having an ectopic pregnancy. This is because the β-HCG levels are normally higher in ectopic pregnancy than in normal intrauterine pregnancies, so it is certainly a cause for suspicion.If an ectopic pregnancy is suspected due to your β-HCG levels, your doctor will follow this up with a transvaginal ultrasound to see if she can visualize a pregnancy, and its location.',\n",
       "  ' These ultrasounds can detect 75-85% of ectopic pregnancies (the growing fetus will be able to be seen on ultrasound in that percentage of cases, which confirms its location).Note that a negative ultrasound does not rule out an ectopic pregnancy. A positive ultrasound (one that confirms the presence of a pregnancy in the fallopian tubes or elsewhere outside the uterus), however, is enough to make the diagnosis.If the ultrasound is negative (i.e. inconclusive), but the β-HCG level is high and your symptoms are enough to concern your doctor that you may have an ectopic pregnancy, your doctor will likely recommend a \"diagnostic laparoscopy,\" which is a simple surgery with very small incisions where they can insert cameras into your abdomen to have a clearer look.',\n",
       "  ' If your blood tests and ultrasounds seem inconclusive, and an ectopic pregnancy is still suspected, your doctor may perform a diagnostic laparoscopy to visualize your pelvic and abdominal organs internally to look for the spot of implantation.This procedure usually lasts for 30 minutes to an hour.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Once the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is confirmed, your doctor will want to treat you very quickly. This is because the treatment for ectopic pregnancy is much simpler when done sooner rather than later. Also, it is impossible for an ectopic tubal pregnancy to \"survive\"; in other words, the fetus won\\'t be able to live anyway, so removing the pregnancy sooner rather than later prevents complications (which, if left too long, may become life-threatening).',\n",

It is given via intramuscular injection, one or more times, depending upon how much is needed to successfully get rid of the ectopic pregnancy.After the injection of methotrexate is given, you will receive repeat blood tests to check your β-HCG level. If it drops to near zero (undetectable in the blood test), the treatment will be deemed successful; if not, you will receive more methotrexate injections until this goal is reached, and if it still not attained you may need surgery.',\n",

They have several parts that work together, but knowing a bit about how they work together will hopefully help you get the most of out you or your friend\\'s, bong.\\n\\n\\n\\nMouthpiece: This is the opening at the end of the tube where you place your mouth. When placing your mouth on the inhale hole, place your lips inside, not over, the hole. Purse them slightly and force them gently into the hole so that the outside of your lips creates an airtight seal.\\n\\nChamber: This is where the smoke accumulates, ready to be inhaled. Smoking a bong is a two-part activity -- you fill the chamber of smoke, then \"clear\" it with quick inhale at the end.\\n\\nBowl (Slide): This holds your smoking material. It is sometimes called a slide because you remove it from the downstem as the final step before inhaling the smoke in the smoke chamber.\\n\\nDownstem: A small tube that connects the water in the bottom of the bong to the bottom of the slide. It may be defused (notched at the bottom) or a simple tube. The smoke travels through the downstem and into the water. Some bongs do not have downstems and instead have a molded glass tube leading from the slide into the chamber. The water should always be higher than the downstem.\\n\\nCarb (Optional): A hole on the side of the bond above the water level, the carb is kept covered while the slide is being lit and then uncovered when the user is ready to inhale the smoke. Most water bongs, however, do not have a carb, unless they are wooden or porcelain.;\\n',\n",
       "  ' Remove the downstem and fill the chamber with water so that all the holes in the downstem are covered. It should be low enough so that it doesn\\'t spill out of the carb, if you have one. Try to get the water between 1\" and 1/2\" above the end of the downstem. The temperature is a matter of preference-- some people love cold, some warm, and many are fine with room temperature.Contrary to popular belief, more water does not lead to a better experience. It takes your lungs effort to pull air through water, so more water just means you are working harder to pull the smoke through.\\nTest the amount of water by taking a quick, deep breath through the mouthpiece -- it should bubble up but never come to your lips.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Percolators, or percs, are small additions in the neck and chamber of the bong that further filter your smoke. They can be branched like trees, circular discs, notched tubes, rounded domes, or a variety of other shapes depending on the glassblower. Their purpose is all the same -- they provide more air and water to diffuse and cool the smoke. Fill the percolator with enough water to cover any air holes with a few millimeters of water.\\n\\n\\nYou may have to fill a percolator through the mouthpiece instead of the downstem.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'How to Prevent a Bulging Disc2': [' Lifting heavy objects improperly is the most common cause of back injuries, including bulging discs. Lift from your legs rather than your back. Stand as close as possible to the object that you wish to lift, with feet spread apart to give you a wide base. Then squat down and bend your knees, lifting up using the large muscles in your legs. As you lift, hold the object close to your body to reduce the strain on your back.Do not bend at the waist!\\nIf an object is too heavy for you to lift on your own, seek help.\\nAlso keep in mind that there is a greater risk of injury within one hour of waking up. This is because your spine has been in a horizontal position during sleep and has not fully rehydrated. Avoid lifting anything within one hour of waking up, especially if the movement involves twisting and bending.\\n\\n',\n",

While certain other factors may affect a person's capacity for physical growth, the distinct medical condition that is full-blown, genuine growth stunting results primarily from malnutrition. Someone who starves or doesn't have access to essential nutrients as a young child is likely to become stunted, whereas someone who, for instance, drinks coffee as a teenager is not going to become stunted.;\\n\",\n",
       "  ' UNICEF pinpoints a person\\'s first 1,000 days of life (about 3 years) as the crucial window during which stunting can occur. Depriving a child of food or important nutrients during this time frame will lead to stunted growth and a significantly reduced size for the rest of their life, unless new medical research can reverse it.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s impossible to \"retroactively\" stunt a person\\'s growth. In other words, while starving later in life may cause a drop in body weight or slowed growth, a person won\\'t suffer the worst, most permanent effects of growth stunting.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" The physical and mental effects are extremely serious and cannot be undone, even with the benefit of modern medicine. Someone with stunted growth will suffer not only from reduced body size and weight for their entire lives, but from a variety of other debilitating problems. Collectively, these problems can reduce the length and quality of the stunted person's life. These problems include:Weakness\\nDelayed brain development\\nLearning disorders/difficulties\\nDisproportionate height/mass ratio (i.e., chubby appearance)\\nUnderdeveloped bones\\nDelayed organ development\\nWeakened immune system\\n\\n\",\n",

Calcium is crucial for healthy teeth and bones and for properly-functioning muscles. By the time you're old enough to make a conscious decision to avoid calcium, the window for stunted growth will be long past. Thus, even though cutting calcium from your diet can cause your height to decrease, it won't technically lead to actual stunted growth. It will, however, lead to the following dangerous symptoms:Weak bones and teeth (which can contribute to decay and fracture)\\nFaintness\\nDifficulty swallowing\\nLung spasms\\nSpine and hip pain\\nBrittle nails and hair\\nAnxiety and irritability\\nLoss of mobility\\nSeizures (in severe cases)\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \" Perhaps the most common, wide-spread myth about stunted growth is that it can be a result of drinking caffeine during the childhood or teen years. This is simply not supported by scientific evidence.Excessive caffeine intake won't make you shorter, but can make you jittery, irritable, hyperactive, and/or paranoid.\\n\\n\\nCaffeine can also keep you from getting as much sleep as you need. This can lead to a weakened immune system, drowsiness, and decreased physical and mental performance, among other symptoms. Lack of sleep can also interfere with the release of natural growth hormones,at night and, over time, can inhibit growth (see below).\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" While full-blown growth stunting is the result of malnutrition during infancy, certain other factors can have been linked to decreased growth potential, especially when they occur during a child's growing years.

In fact, even children who use mild steroid inhalers to treat asthma have been found to have heights that are, on average, half an inch lower than those of children who didn't use the inhalers.In general, steroids should only be given to children for legitimate medical problems after being prescribed by a qualified medical professional. Under no circumstances should children take non-prescription steroids.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \" Once the shoulder is relocated and the pain is reduced and under control, then it's time to prepare the shoulder area to be strapped. In order for straps and tape to adhere to the shoulder area, the skin covering the joint needs to be cleaned and shaved to remove any hair.As such, gently clean the skin around the shoulder with soap and water, then apply some shave cream and carefully remove any hair (if applicable) with a safety razor.\\n\\n\\nAfter you finish shaving the skin, dry the area thoroughly and wait at least a few hours for any skin irritation to go away. Then consider applying some adhesive spray just prior to applying any tape of straps — it will help the straps and/or tape stick to the skin better.\\nHair not only prevents tape from sticking, but it also causes pain when the tape and/or bandaging is removed at a later time.\\nDepending on how much hair is present, you may need to shave around the shoulder, shoulder blade, nipples and the lower neck.\\n\\n\",\n",

Cilia help remove excess fluids and particles--paralyzing them will stop them from helping you remove excess fluids in your airways caused by your pneumonia.\\nAnother effect of smoking is the irritation from the smoke itself which causes increased fluid secretion into airway passages.\\n\\n',\n",

A heart attack is a circulation problem, caused by a blockage that prevents adequate blood flow to the heart.

Brain damage can occur within seconds and may be permanent. Death often occurs within four to six minutes if CPR or an AED are not utilized. These measures improve survival odds, but not overwhelmingly.Most cases of cardiac arrest are caused by a heart attack; cardiomyopathy (an enlarged heart); valvular heart disease; electrical problems in the heart, such as long QT syndrome; or a congenital heart defect. Heart defects are the most common cause of cardiac arrest among seemingly healthy children and young adults.\\n\\n',\n",

Abrasive blasting (“sandblasting”) to remove paint, rust, etc. is perhaps the most likely source, as the blasting material itself is often primarily silica.When possible, consider using materials that don’t contain silica for industrial applications. For instance, there are numerous sandblasting material options that don’t contain any sand (which is primarily silica).\\nOften, however, the very nature of a job or task requires the creation of silica dust, so be prepared to take other measures to reduce exposure.;\\n',\n",
       "  ' Silica dust can only harm you if you breathe it in. The use of respirators intended to filter out silica dust will substantially reduce the risk of negative health consequences. The use of such respirators is usually required by law and safety codes as well, when engaged in an occupation in which silica dust exposure is likely.If you are going to be exposed to airborne silica at concentrations of 50 micrograms per cubic meter, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends a half-face particulate respirator with a filter rating of N95 or better (the 95 indicates that the filter was able remove at least 95% of the most-penetrating particles during testing).For higher concentrations of silica particles, you will need a powered or supplied air respirator.Make sure you choose a respirator that is intended to block out silica dust, and that you wear it regularly and properly. The mask needs to create a seal over your mouth and nose.',\n",
       "  ' The less silica dust you create or leave floating around in your vicinity, the less you are likely to inhale. Therefore, proper dust reduction and ventilation procedures are also straightforward ways of reducing silica exposure.If, for instance, your job involves cutting concrete blocks, the use of a wet saw (which dampens potential silica dust) and a vacuum dust collector (which sucks up and isolates dust before it becomes airborne) will significantly reduce the amount of silica available to be inhaled.In fact, studies indicate that the use of wet saws and exhaust ventilators reduce silica concentration in the surrounding air by 96%.',\n",
       "  ' When engaged in activities that produce silica dust, you should wear disposable work suits or gear that can be removed on site and washed. Likewise, washing and showering facilities should be available nearby so you can wash away silica particles on your body or in your hair.You also should not eat or expose food to the area in which the dust is present. Clean up thoroughly before eating off-site.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' The best health and safety practices in regards to silica exposure will vary by the nature of the work being done. Workers in the “fracking” industry will have different needs than glass engravers or tombstone etchers. Consult the recommendations and regulations of your workplace health and safety authority (on the federal level in the U.S., OSHA) for guidance.This construction industry website contains a number of useful videos regarding silica safety in a range of occupations and tasks.\\nCurrent proposed OSHA regulations (as of 2016) recommend limiting exposure to no more than 50 micrograms per cubic meter over the course of an eight hour shift.',\n",
       "  ' In basic terms, silica is the main component of sand, and sand is present in various man-made masonry and concrete products, as well as glass. Silica is also a building block for many types of stone (such as granite) and is abundant in a wide range of soils. Essentially, silica is everywhere around us.Crystalline silica can occur in three forms, with quartz as by far the most common of the three. The other two are cristobalite and tridymite. All three are equally prone to becoming respirable and are equally dangerous if inhaled in large or recurring quantities.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' As you might expect from inhaling bits of grit over long periods of time, silica deposits end up in the lungs and create scarring. Such scarring creates a condition known as silicosis, which can cause significant breathing difficulties and sometimes even death. There is no cure and limited treatment options for silicosis.Silica dust is also a known carcinogen, and smokers are even more likely to develop lung cancer if they also have silica deposits in their lungs. Kidney damage and other health problems can also sometimes occur due to prolonged silica inhalation.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' If you are regularly engaged in utilizing silica (sand) in abrasive blasting, whether to clean fine jewelry or remove peeling house paint, you are likely to be exposed to high concentrations of silica dust on a daily basis. Similarly, if your work involves cutting, grinding, breaking up, or etching materials rich in silica — such as concrete, granite, or glass — you are also at an elevated risk for exposure.Silica dust inhalation must usually occur consistently over a lengthy period of time to become a health hazard, however. Chronic silicosis, the most common form of the disease, occurs after 15-20 years of moderate exposure. Accelerated silicosis occurs after 5-10 years of high exposure. In rare cases, acute silicosis can occur after two years or less of extreme exposure to silica dust. All of these forms of silicosis are equally dangerous.\\n\\n',\n",

The current limits vary by job type and range from 100 to 250 on the same scale.If you are in charge of your work conditions, be vigilant in making sure you remain within the current silica dust exposure limits and follow all safety protocols. Do so not only to prevent running afoul of OSHA inspectors, but more importantly to safeguard the health of your workers and yourself. If you are not in charge of your work conditions, do your part to make sure the limits and regulations are known and being followed.

While other leg exercises can actually add bulk, long running sessions generally reduce bulk by causing you to lose fat over time and build toned muscles.Running for about 45 minutes to an hour four or more times per week should begin to produce noticeable results within about a month or so. However, if you're not able to run for this long at first, just run for as long as you can in a single session and aim to increase the length of time you run for by one minute each time. Eventually, you'll reach an optimal level of cardio ability.\\nTry to avoid cardio exercises that involve shorter, higher-intensity workouts.

Most of the time you will not be able to hear sharp sounds; however, dull sounds will remain intact. The actual cause of this ailment is unknown but three theories may likely explain how hearing loss in acoustic neuroma occurs:Compression on the vestibulocochlear nerve. The vestibular nerve is for maintenance of balance and is the one in which the acoustic neuroma develops whereas the cochlear or hearing nerve is for hearing. The compression of the acoustic neuroma onto the hearing nerve is theorized to cause slowly progressive hearing loss.Blockage of the internal auditory artery. Blockade of the internal auditory artery (which supplies the inner ear where the eighth cranial nerve is located), would cause damage to the inner ear structures including the eighth nerve and may cause hearing loss.\\n\\nBiochemical changes in the fluids of the inner ear.

If your pain is determined to be legitimate (not feigned) but not directly explicable by an existing medical condition (an illness) or substance (such as a medication), pain disorder should be considered as a distinct possibility.A psychiatrist or other mental health professional is often involved in the diagnosis of pain disorder. He or she may do so in part by asking a series of questions, such as:\\n\\nIs an existing medical condition causing the pain? If no, …\\nIs the patient falsely claiming pain (feigning) for any number of reasons? If no, …\\nWhat is the precise nature and severity of the pain?\\nWhat are the psychological factors contributing to the pain?\\n\\n;\\n',\n",
       "  ' Because pain disorder is defined at least as much by what it is not as by what it is, each individual case is distinctive. In general terms, pain disorder is created out of a combination of physical and psychological factors, but the precise balance of these factors can vary widely. As such, each case should be considered closely by medical professionals in both the physical and psychological fields.In the most simplified categorization, there are three types of pain disorder: pain disorder with significant medical and psychological factors; pain disorder without significant medical factors; and pain disorder without significant psychological factors.\\nIf your pain disorder trends more towards psychological factors, so too should your treatment; if it is more physical, the same holds for the treatment. In all cases, though, coordinated physical and psychological treatment is warranted.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' The pain associated with pain disorder can occur in any part of the body, so long as it does not align with any causative condition. So, if you have a broken foot but pain in your abdomen, that could possibly be pain disorder, but so too could abdominal pain that does not align with the stomach ulcer you have.\\n\\n\\nAlthough the pain can present anywhere in the body, the most common pain sites seem to be the lower back, head, abdomen, and chest. The severity and duration of the pain can vary widely, from short bursts of intense pain to lingering amounts of moderate pain, and everything in between.',\n",
       "  ' Regardless of the precise location, duration, or severity of your pain, one of the hallmarks of pain disorder is that it almost invariably causes emotional distress and changes in behavior. Such changes occur in large part because the pain seems inexplicable and easy to doubt as real (by other people, some medical professionals, and even the patient). Identifying such changes can help with the diagnosis of pain disorder and the determination of its specific nature in your case. People with pain disorder often develop strong feelings of hopelessness and helplessness, since there often seems to be no way to explain or do anything about the pain. This can in turn cause the person to become inactive and passive and develop conditions like insomnia, chronic fatigue, anxiety, and depression, as well as cause disruptions in normal social relationships.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' People with pain disorder often struggle to convince themselves and others that their pain exists in spite of the lack of a clear physical cause. Many have probably heard someone say that the pain is “all in your head,” as if it is imaginary. Actually, though, the pain experienced by all people has a mental component to it, so pain is in fact “in all of our heads.”All pain, whether caused by pain disorder or a bump on the head, is in part a “psychological response to noxious stimuli.”Both body and mind are involved in the experience of pain, and both areas need to be addressed in order to effectively treat pain disorder.\\nAddressing your mental health is not a sign that your pain disorder is imaginary, then; it is instead a critical element of managing the condition.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' The ongoing physical discomfort and emotional anguish of pain disorder causes many sufferers to feel hopeless about doing anything about it. A coordinated effort among the patient, physician, and mental health professional, however, can develop coping skills to better identify, manage, and overcome both the pain and the hopelessness.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), under the guidance of a psychiatrist or other mental health professional, produces positive results for many pain disorder sufferers. CBT can help patients recognize the environmental and emotional factors that make the pain worse; develop both tension-reduction and confidence-building exercises; and formulate motivational strategies to overcome the pain and passivity that inhibit normal activities.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' People with pain disorder are invariably anxious and stressed out due to the condition. The constant physical and emotional barrage caused by the disorder creates tension that must be released, ideally in a healthy and helpful manner. Utilizing tension-reduction techniques under professional guidance is therefore a key element in the treatment of pain disorder.Work with you mental health professional to determine the techniques that are most effective for you. Options include (but are not limited to) progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, talk therapy, biofeedback, and hypnosis.\\nPain diaries, in which you take note of the details of your daily pain experiences (and responses to them), can also be very helpful. The simple act of recording (and legitimizing) what you are experiencing can help you to “let go” of stress and anxiety.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' The longer a person suffers from pain disorder, the more difficult it becomes to treat. This is the case largely because the disorder creates a vicious cycle of pain and worry — you feel pain, you worry about the pain you felt and what will be coming next, and soon the disorder seems to take control of your life. One of the critical elements of managing pain disorder is reinforcing the patient’s drive and desire to live a full and active life.There is a fine line to be drawn here. Pain disorder sufferers shouldn’t feel as though they are being told to “suck it up,” toughen up, and pretend the pain doesn’t exist. Rather, in combination with coping and motivational techniques under the guidance of a mental health professional, the patient can break the pain-and-worry cycle and limit the disorder to a more manageable state.\\n\\n',\n",

Children with pain disorder (and their loved ones) will usually derive particular benefits from family counseling. No child should feel like he or she has to deal with pain disorder alone.\\nConsider joining a support network with others facing pain disorder. Sometimes it’s simply best to talk to someone who really understands what you’re going through.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' A great deal of the treatment regimen for pain disorder involves learning to understand and cope with the condition. Direct treatment of the physical pain experienced due to the disorder is also a normal and important treatment component, though. Once again, coordination between your physician and mental health professional is of critical importance.Usually, pain treatment begins with acetaminophen or NSAIDs prescribed by your doctor. Other, more powerful painkillers may be considered as needed, but will usually be prescribed with caution, out of fear of dependency and other concerns. Take all medications as prescribed and discuss their effectiveness and any side effects with your doctor.\\nSometimes, depending upon the nature, location, and severity of your pain, your doctor may prescribe nerve blocking agents or surgical ablation, which removes certain nerve pathways in the affected area.\\n\\n',\n",

Do not hesitate to consult your prescribing physician with questions or concerns.\\n\\n',\n",

There are also a range of other techniques you can try which are generally harmless and have varying degrees of evidence of effectiveness. Keep your medical team “in the loop” regarding all treatment methods you utilize, though.If you have pain disorder, you may find some degree of relief and relaxation via acupuncture, massage, meditation, yoga, music or art therapy, hobbies, or regular exercise, among many other options.

If your symptoms last longer than this your bronchitis may be chronic.If you experience blue-tinged lips and swelling in the ankles, feet, and legs, call your emergency services immediately.\\nIf you are not a smoker and have no symptoms specific to chronic bronchitis, you are likely experiencing acute bronchitis.

If you've had a long-lasting cold or have a medical condition that weakens immunity, such as HIV/AIDS, you are at increased risk. You're also more susceptible if your immune system is lower due to age. Young children and the elderly are more vulnerable to viral infections that lead to bronchitis.If your job involves regular exposure to lung irritants, including ammonia, acids, chlorine, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, or bromine, you are at risk of developing bronchitis. These lung irritants easily make their way inside the lungs, which can cause inflammation and blocked air passages.Gastric reflux can irritate the throat and make you more susceptible to bronchitis.If you are a smoker, you are at increased risk for both chronic and acute bronchitis.

Children often experience vomiting and diarrhea as part of childhood illnesses.They may also not be able to understand or communicate when they need fluids.Older people may not experience thirst sensations as regularly, and their bodies do not conserve water as well. Some older people may also have conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, that make it difficult to communicate their needs to caregivers.People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart failure, or kidney disease, are more likely to become dehydrated. People may also take medications that contribute to dehydration (diuretic drugs).\\nAcute illnesses such as influenza can also increase your risk of dehydration. Fever and sore throat make you less likely to want to drink.Heavy exercisers, especially endurance athletes, are at a higher risk of dehydration because their bodies may lose more water than they are able to consume; however, dehydration is also cumulative, so you can become dehydrated over the course of a few days even with light exercise if you don’t consume enough water.\\nPeople in very hot climates or who are frequently exposed to prolonged heat are at higher risk. For example, construction workers and other people who work outside all day are at an elevated risk for dehydration. This is especially true if it is also humid in that climate. Sweat does not evaporate well in humid, hot environments, so your body has more trouble cooling itself.People who live at high altitudes (above 8,200 ft/2,500 m) are at an increased risk for dehydration. Your body may resort to increased urination and rapid breathing to keep your body oxygenated, both of which contribute to dehydration.;\\n',\n",

You can experience heart failure on the left side or ventricle, on the right side or right ventricle, or both sides of your heart at once. In general, heart failure starts on the left side of your heart, which is your heart’s main pumping chamber. Heart conditions that can lead to heart failure include:Coronary artery disease: This is the most common form of heart disease and the most common cause of heart failure. If you have this disease, your arteries begin to narrow due to a buildup of fatty deposits, causing a reduction of blood flow to your heart. This disease can lead to a heart attack, as the buildup of fatty deposits can cause a blood clot to form and block blood flow to your heart.\\nHigh blood pressure or hypertension: Blood pressure is amount of force of blood that is pumped to your heart by your arteries. If you have high blood pressure, this means your heart has to work harder than normal to circulate blood throughout your body. Over time, your heart muscle may become thicker to make up for the extra work it needs to perform to get blood to all your organs. This could then cause your heart muscle to become too stiff or weak to pump blood effectively.\\nFaulty heart valves: You can develop faulty heart valves due to a heart defect, coronary artery disease or a heart infection and it can force your heart to work harder than normal to keep blood flowing in your body as it should. This extra work can weaken your heart and lead to heart failure. However, it is possible to fix faulty heart valves if they are treated in time.\\nDamage to your heart muscle, or cardiomyopathy: Damage to your heart muscle can be caused by diseases, infections, alcohol abuse and drug abuse. Some drugs used for chemotherapy can also lead to cardiomyopathy. As well, you may be genetically predisposed to developing cardiomyopathy.\\nAbnormal heart rhythms or heart arrhythmias: This condition can cause your heart to beat too fast, which forces your heart to work overtime to pump blood to your body. A slow heartbeat can also prevent your heart from getting enough blood to your body and could lead to heart failure.\\nThe causes of acute heart failure can include viruses that attack your heart muscles, allergic reactions, severe infections, blood clots in your lungs, and the use of certain medications.\\n\\n',\n",

Place the tape against the wall and measure up from the floor to your mark.You can use any marking device, however, a pencil is best as you can erase the marks when you are finished. Just make sure to make a dark enough mark so that it is visible when you pull away.\\nMake sure that you keep the tape straight as you go up from the wall. It should also lay lightly against the wall. You can use a straight ruler instead if you so choose, making a wall mark every 12 inches and then adding it all up.\\nIf you are measuring yourself you can do this method too, just make sure to keep the pencil level. It also helps if you are using a wall opposite a mirror so you can track your movements.\\n\\n',\n",

Have the person stand against the board and then adjust the rod so that it rests on the top of the person’s head. With a manual stadiometer, you will need to write down the height where the rod meets the board. With a digital stadiometer, the height will be displayed immediately after you adjust the rod.It is not necessary to push the measuring rod down upon the person’s head. It is enough to lightly touch the head with the rod.\\n\\n',\n",

Use a measuring tape to measure from the base of their feet to the top of their head.Be aware that this method is less accurate when used with taller persons. So, try to use a stand-up wall method whenever possible.This is often a good option for children who are moving around a great deal, but who are too big for the infant measuring device and too wiggly to stand up against the stadiometer.\\nYou can also make a pen or marker mark at the base of their feet and at the top of their head and measure between the marks.

If a person is generally critical or negative, chances are they would complain about anyone.

Does he or she complain about work, school, and other friends? If so, this person may simply have a negative outlook. Their criticism is a reflection of that worldview. It is not an objective judgement of your character.Try to remember you're worthwhile. There may be some thread of validity to the criticism. We could all use to improve in some areas. However, flaws and imperfections do not define your character. Your roommate may be right when he points out you always forget to throw out empty milk containers. However, he's choosing to focus on that flaw over your other qualities.;\\n\",\n",

Even if it\\'s difficult, try to resist arguing.\\n\\n\\nUse empathetic listening when someone is being critical. Simply repeat what the critical person is saying to you. This shows you\\'re listening without forcing you to give in to unreasonable demands. This is a better technique than engaging in an argument. For example, say something like, \"So, I\\'m hearing you think it\\'s unfair that I forgot to wash my dinner plate last night?\"Critical people will often try to force you to engage with them. If you respond empathetically, they may continue to level criticism. Instead of arguing back, calmly state your opinion. You could say, \"I\\'m sorry that was frustrating for you, but I honestly forgot. I\\'ll just clean it up now and try to remember next time.\" If a person is very critical, they may continue to berate you past this point. Do not egg the person on. Simply continue to restate your opinion. Eventually, the other person will get bored and back off.',\n",

Learn to tune it out.\\n\\n\\nOverly critical people thrive on conflict and drama. The more you respond, the more likely they\\'ll be to criticize. Therefore, try just responding with monosyllabic answers. When met with criticism, say something like, \"Uh-huh,\" \"Yeah,\" or \"Okay.\"',\n",

If someone you live with criticizes you frequently, have some compassion.\\n\\n\\nUnderstand you only have to deal with a critical person in the moment. A critical person, on the other hand, has to deal with him or herself all the time. There's a good chance your roommate, family member, romantic partner, or friend criticizes you because of his or her own sense of inadequacy.When someone is criticizing you, consider that person's perspective. There may be reasons he or she is overly critical. For example, say you're a college student living at home. Your father may constantly berate you about your study habits. Consider his perspective. Maybe your dad never got a chance to go to school himself. He could feel insecure in your presence as you're achieving something he never had the chance to achieve. The criticism is not personal. It's a reflection of your father's unhappiness. Sometimes, simply having compassion for someone can ease your frustration with that person.\",\n",

As stated previously, we all have bad habits. It can be annoying if your roommate complains continuously that you leave the bathroom floor wet after you shower. However, someone could slip and fall.

If you tend to laugh loudly when watching funny movies, this is more of a personality trait than a conscious choice. In this case, the criticism may be unfair.How is the criticism expressed? If you're living with someone, you need to be able to communicate. If you're doing something that bothers your living partner, that person has a right to express him or herself. However, how criticism is expressed matters. If the other person is yelling, using foul language, or otherwise being harsh, this is not reasonable.Why is this person criticizing you? Do you think your roommate genuinely wants you to change, or do you think she just enjoys complaining?\",\n",

Eventually, they may learn how to better communicate with you.For example, say your roommate is lecturing you excessively on how you mop the floor. You\\'ve already mopped the floor that day. You know you\\'ll forget this advice the next time the chore needs to be done. Say something like, \"I understand you want me to change how I mop the floor.

When expressing your frustration, use \"I\"-statements. These are statements designed to highlight personal feelings over blame. You express how something made you feel instead of passing objective judgement on a situation.I statements have three parts. You start with \"I feel\" and state you feeling. After this, you explain the behavior that led to this feeling. Finally, you explain why you feel this way. This helps avoid blame. You are not telling someone they\\'re objectively wrong, but rather emphasizing how their actions affect you.For example, say your boyfriend always criticizes you for taking too long in the shower. Do not say, \"It\\'s really irritating when you get on my case about my shower time. I don\\'t bother you when you\\'re in the bathroom. This is disrespectful.\" When you use language like this, even though you may have a valid point, your boyfriend may feel unfairly blamed or judged.Instead, rephrase your feelings using an \"I\"-statement.

Don’t use this as an excuse not to get up and be active, however, as improving your overall fitness will provide a greater, lasting benefit.You can also alter your position to improve your ability to breathe and increase oxygen saturation. This is a non-invasive way to improve your oxygen saturation. For example, if you are laying down, elevate the head of your bed to at least 30 degrees.

This is because a few studies have suggested potential cardiovascular benefits when using these medications in conjunction with medical therapies to lower LDL, but the data is not convincing enough to definitively recommend their use in all cases.Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) is a protein in your body that facilitates the transfer of lipids from HDL to other components in your blood. It has also been found to be associated with lower levels of HDL in some studies. As a result, there are several trials looking into medication that inhibit CETP, such as the medications torcetrapib, anacetrapib, dalcetrapib, and evacetrapib.

       "  ' Too much fat in the blood, which is caused by too much bad cholesterol, is directly associated with a higher risk of stroke and heart attack. It leads to atherosclerosis, which results in narrowing and stiffening of the blood vessels. This results in elevated blood pressures. Increased pressures in the blood vessels can result in fatty plaques breaking off and blocking smaller, narrowed vessels downstream. Blocking blood flow can lead to tissue death, which causes a heart attack or a stroke.It can also lead to heart failure. Narrowing and stiffness of the vessels in the body forces the heart to pump harder to achieve appropriate blood flow. The muscle of the heart grows larger to compensate for this. Eventually, the work required of the heart may go beyond its capacity, leading to insufficient blood flow and fluid build-up, which is called heart failure.',\n",

During these tests, blood will be drawn after a period of 12 to 14 hours of fasting.\\n\\n\\nThere are several different cholesterol levels reported from these tests. These include total cholesterol, which is normal below 200 mg/dL. Your doctor will also test for LDL cholesterol, which needs to be below 130 mg/dL or lower if at risk of heart attacks or strokes, and HDL cholesterol, which need to be above 60 mg/dL. It also checks non-HDL cholesterol, which is normal below 160 mg/dL, and triglycerides, which are normal below 150 mg/dL.Any abnormality in these tests may be associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Most frequently, an abnormally low level of HDL is also associated with elevated levels of LDL and triglycerides. Sometimes a person may have cholesterol and triglyceride levels that are all normal, except for an isolated low HDL. This is still associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In contrast, studies have suggested that having high levels of this good type of cholesterol is associated with prolonged life and significantly reduced risk of heart disease. ',\n",

Walter Thompson Intelligence notes that healthy behaviors (like eating better and exercising more) tend to pair together — as do unhealthy ones, for that matter — as opposed the the healthy / less healthy teaming of exercise and moderate-to-heavy drinking. Yet the organization also recognizes that there does seem to be something more than a new fad behind this pairing. After all, there have been “beer leagues” in softball and bowling far longer than millennials have been around.It turns out that scientists have also wondered about whether the anecdotal pairing of exercise with increased alcohol consumption has a basis in fact. And, the results indicate that there is indeed a correlation — on days when people exercise more, they are more likely to consume more alcohol than normal.',\n",
       "  ' Legitimate scientific research shows that, notwithstanding factors like age group or day of the week, increased exercise and increased alcohol consumption tend to happen on the same day. The trickier question, it turns out, is “why?”.At first blush, it may seem like some combination of “celebration” and “guilt” is the likely cause. That is, an individual wants to congratulate himself for completing a triathlon, so he enjoys a party and drinks heavily. Or, a person knows she’s going to be out all night partying, so she schedules a hard-core workout either the day before or after to make up for it.These factors can play a role in the pairing, but don’t seem to tell the whole story.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Researchers have determined that the same area of the brain is stimulated by both physical exertion and alcohol consumption. Both of them activate your “neural reward circuitry,” creating feelings of pleasure. Exercise triggers this response because of the advantages of physical activity since humankind’s earliest times. Alcohol was embraced by our ancestors in part because they found that it just happens to trigger the same pleasure response based on its chemistry.Both exercise and alcohol spur a release of dopamine as well as endorphins, both of which stimulate the euphoric feeling you can get after a vigorous workout or a few drinks with friends.Since the two activities tend to make us feel the same, it is seemingly natural for us to want to pair them in order to multiply the effect — or to “keep the good times rolling.”\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Exercise and alcohol consumption may in fact be a natural pairing instead of the “odd couple” you might have assumed. This doesn’t necessarily make healthonism “healthy,” however. Too much of either activity (but especially drinking) — or too much of both — can have negative consequences, regardless of whether your brain rewards you with a pleasure response.\\n\\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption after exercise impairs protein synthesis in your muscles, a process that is critical to muscle repair and building. So, basically, if you drink too much after exercising, you won’t physically recover as quickly, and any muscle-building benefits will be decreased. Moderate alcohol consumption should have limited or no negative impact in this area.',\n",
       "  ' Always keep in mind that alcoholic beverages are almost entirely empty calories without nutritional value. Also, don’t underestimate the calorie counts of alcoholic beverages, and the amount of exercise required to balance out those calories. Without burning off at least as many calories as you are taking in, there isn’t that much “health” to healthonism, after all.For instance, a pint of beer has approximately 180 calories, meaning it takes the average person about one-half hour of running to burn off two pints. Some simple math will tell you that if you go on a drinking binge, you’ll need to do a lot of running to make up for it.\\nAlso, because alcohol is treated as a toxic substance by the body (hence the term “intoxication”), your body will focus on getting rid of the alcohol instead of other typical functions. This means, for example, that you may burn less fat by way of your workout if you consume excessive alcohol.\\n\\n'],\n",

In fact, when infants have milia, most doctors will recommend that you do not attempt any special treatment. Merely wash your baby's skin with warm water and pat it dry with a soft towel every day.;\\n\",\n",

The moisturizer will reduce the build up of dead skin cells below your skin and the exfoliating aspect will allow your skin to release the dead cells that have already accumulated. Look for a moisturizer that contains vitamin A. It should also be free of any heavy oils.A targeted exfoliating treatment is best if you have a few milia that you want to get rid of, but otherwise have no skin problems. Choose a targeted treatment containing salicylic acid. The treatment should be applied directly to the milia once daily until they disappear, but check the label to make sure.',\n",

There are four main conditions that vitamin E has been said to help prevent or treat.Heart disease: Vitamin E may prevent the oxidation of LDL-cholesterol. This is believed to help prevent atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Vitamin E may also prevent platelets from aggregating and forming clots in the arteries around the heart — this is a major cause of heart attacks. Large studies have indicated that people who have higher vitamin E intakes tend to have lower rates of heart disease. There is no guarantee, of course, and some of the research is not as supportive of vitamin E as others are.\\nCancer: Cancer represents well over 100 different diseases, so it may not be surprising that there are contradictions in the research on vitamin E and cancer. Several large and well-done trials have not found a significant benefit of taking supplemental Vitamin E. In fact, some studies have shown that taking supplemental vitamin E may increase the risk of prostate cancer.\\nEye diseases: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts cause significant vision loss, especially in older people. One large well-designed trial found that vitamin E, along with beta-carotene, Vitamin C, zinc and copper did reduce the risk of developing AMD.\\nMemory and concentration: The research has been contradictory regarding using vitamin E to prevent memory loss and improve concentration.\\n\\n',\n",
