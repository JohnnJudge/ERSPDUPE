Be it the few words, Twitter allows you or an entire page of indulgence that your own website would allow you. Bring out the most salient features of your creativity, your experience, your passion, and your reasons for painting. Make it clear to readers why you are an artist who loves art, produces high quality art, and is a true champion of art. If you're not great with words, find a friend who can help you with this really important aspect of selling online – the establishment of your credibility and reliability.;\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Depending on what scale you intend to sell your art pieces, you may want to get an account on an online art community or store, like Deviant Art. With 15% -20\\xa0% brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search).\\n\\n\\nRead the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales.\\nIf your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Get yourself out there as best as you can by advertising yourself. Publish some \"example\" pieces around the web to show what you can do and to demonstrate your style. Be sure to add a watermark to your digital version to protect your artwork from art thieves.\\n\\n\\nSpend a little time researching online the ways in which other artists are promoting themselves. What works for them and what doesn\\'t? What do you like about their promotional strategies and what do you want to avoid? This type of research can give you a lot of ideas and also alert you to potential pitfalls for the ways in which you will promote your own artwork. Bookmark the sites of artists selling online that really inspire you, so that you can come back to them regularly to see how they\\'re evolving and succeeding.\\nSeize the power of Twitter and Facebook to increase people\\'s knowledge of you. Tweet updates about your new paintings, your thoughts about art, and news items about art in general. On Facebook, place photos of your artwork, (digitally watermarked), photos of you receiving awards, and information about your art, artwork in general, and perhaps even some critiques of artwork.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Given the hundreds of free blogging websites, you have a lot of choice in keeping a blog. Most importantly, it\\'s extremely useful to keep it updated regularly - this gives people something \"pretty to look at\", and a story to follow as your reputation increases and your sales story grows. A blog can pick up a lot of hits from search engines if you utilize the keywords feature accurately; use it to your advantage. Be sure to name your blog something simple but memorable – you\\'ll want people to be able to find you with ease.\\n\\n\\nRead How to start a blog and How to increase website traffic for free for assistance.\\nA good way to test keywords for very little cost is through using an auction site. Play around with the words you use to title your art sales, as well as the words used within the body of the text. Keep changing the words until you find the sweet spot – words that really do seem to attract the most views.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" This could be your most effective tool if managed well. For every sale you make, every person who sends you an email that might be interested, get all of their email addresses in digital database ready for mass emailing. At designated intervals (once a month, every other week, whenever you start a new series) send them all nice, grammatically correct, friendly emails, complete with a neatly set-out portfolio of the pictures of your recent work (a PDF can work well for this purpose). This keeps you on the radar of past customers, which is important. And if it's a really wonderful newsletter, you might get lucky and they might send it to all of their friends as well – then even more eyes are seeing your work!\\n\\n\\nEvery thoughtful mailing list includes an opt-out option. Don't be threatened by this; see it as good housekeeping and as retaining the clients who really do want to see your items. You're not online to hassle people who aren't interested!\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Like they say, \"a picture\\'s worth a thousand words\" and you\\'ll want your impression on potential customers to be good. Show detail, right down to paint strokes and paint type. Be willing to show potential buyers multiple shots of your work under different light, hung on a wall, etc. This may be the only way to alleviate the justifiable fear many people have of buying a work of art that they have never seen in person.\\n\\n\\nBear in mind that not everyone has a good internet connection.

       "  \" Having your own site means that you can optimize every page for search engines and it sets you apart from the many artists who only use general art sales sites. Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.).\\n\\n\\nIf you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com.\\nGive serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment.\\nAdd prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion.\\nWhen creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" An online art business needs to be built up little by little. It's much the same as putting together a company (indeed, you should treat your online art sales as a business) – you will try to make your name known, or at least give people a hint on who you are as an artist, develop your services as you grow, and gain in reputation as time goes on. It may feel like a long time at the beginning but solid and patient foundations will set you up for a good future, as well as maintaining a positive attitude about what you're doing.\\n\\n\\nAttend as many relevant art shows to show your work as you can. If the shows are juried, display the awards your art has won as part of your profiles or website backgrounds.\\n\\n\"],\n",

While some people might still know your real name, keeping your real name separate from your stage name can afford you some level of privacy.\\n\\nDifferentiation: If your real name is very common, a stage name can help you stand out and be more memorable.\\n\\nPrejudice considerations: Some people have used stage names in the past in order to decrease immediate reactions of racism, anti-Semitism or other forms of prejudice. Luckily, this is less often the case today. Similarly, some women may have avoided a hyphenated name because it might indicate they’re married, which unfortunately some consider to be detrimental to their careers.;\\n',\n",

Does your stage name suit an older performer just as well as a younger one?\\n\\n\\nChild performers should consider how their names will grow with them as they get older. Joe Yule called himself Mickey Rooney, a good name for a kid actor. But it was less useful as an adult actor.

Often, a large part of what is spent on food is more about entertainment than to provide appropriate nutrition. Instead of making “going out to dinner” a family activity, make cooking dinner together at home the evening's entertainment. Home cooked food is much less expensive and can be a lot more fun! Some entertaining ways to cook at home include:\\n\\n\\nBaking and decorating cookies or a cake with younger children. Kids love to ice and decorate cookies and cakes. Buy plenty of sprinkles, colored icings, and small candies and let them go to work.\\nTeaching older children a family recipe by preparing it together. Many older children are interested in learning how to prepare family favorites, and what better way to learn than by preparing them together?\\nMaking individual or personal pizzas. Using bagels, flour tortillas, French bread, or pizza dough, make a personal size pizza for each family member and allow everyone to top their own pies from a selection of vegetables, cheeses, meats, etc.\\nExperimenting with new things. For example, if you have always been interested in Indian cuisine, use curry in your cooking. Find new ways to prepare favorite vegetables or test out new recipes.

Here's a brief summary of the different methods and their main features that will help you decide:\\n\\n\\n\\nAcid etching method: this method requires extreme safety measure, the availability of many materials such as the etchant and it is somewhat slow. The quality of PCB obtained varies according to the materials you use but generally, it is a good method for simple to intermediate levels of complexity circuits. Circuits involving more close wiring and tiny wires usually use other methods.\\n\\nUV etching method: this method is used for transposition of your PCB layout onto your PCB board and requires more expensive materials that might not be available everywhere. However, the steps are relatively simple and can produce finer and more complicated circuit layouts.\\n\\nMechanical etching/routing method: this method requires special machines that will mechanically etch away unnecessary copper from the board or route empty separators between wires. It can be expensive if you intend to buy one of those machines and usually leasing them requires the availability of a workshop nearby. However, this method is good if you need to create many copies of the circuit and also can produce fine PCBs.\\n\\nLaser etching method: this is usually used by large production companies, but can be found on some universities. The concept is similar to mechanical etching but LASER beams are used to etch the board. It is usually hard to access such machines, but if your local university is one of the lucky ones having such machine, you can use their facilities if they allow it.;\\n\",\n",

They generally appear where the person's body touches the mattress, such as the bottom of the feet, the shoulders, the buttocks, and the back of the head.To combat pressure sores, try to change your parent's position every 2 hours, and encourage them to move their body in the bed as much as possible. You can also find special mattresses and cushions that can help relieve pressure points.\\nPay attention to the sheets. They should be cotton or silk, and you should smooth them out before putting your parent on them, as wrinkled sheets can increase the chance of bed sores.\\nMake sure your parent's skin is moisturized regularly. Also, avoid using scented soaps and talcum powder, as those can dry out the skin. Dry skin makes your parent more susceptible to bed sores. It can also help to make sure your parent is drinking at least 2 liters of fluid a day.\\nOn people with darker skin, you may see blue or purple patches, while the patches will be red or white on lighter-skinned people. Cracks, wrinkles, swelling, shiny areas, blisters, and dry areas are also indicators of bed sores. Talk to a nurse if you start noticing these signs.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' When laying in bed regularly, liquids can build up in the lungs, leading to congestion and even pneumonia. The best way to combat this problem is to make sure your parent is rotated to a new position regularly, preferably every 2 hours.',\n",
       "  \" The emotional side of a illness can be just as destructive as the physical side. When your parent becomes bedridden, they can't do the things they used to or visit with the people they enjoyed seeing regularly.Encourage people to come over and visit with your parent, so they have regular interaction.\\nAlso, try to encourage your parent to still participate in activities they enjoy as much as possible. For instance, if your parent enjoys making art, get them a small set of art supplies they can use in bed with a table.\\nIt's also important to provide a safe place where your parent can talk about what's going on. They need a sounding board as much as you do. You can be this person some of the time, but make sure that your parent feels comfortable talking with other people as well. If you are their only source of support, then this can put a lot of pressure on you when you already have so much going on.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Often, a person who is bedridden will qualify for having a social worker assist with their needs. A social worker can benefit you, too, as they can help you find the care you need for your parent, as well as other resources.Most hospitals have social services on site, though you can also visit a Medicare/Medicaid office in your local community, or visit the offices of an insurance company that that your parent goes through.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' When your parent is sick, you may feel like you\\'re alone in the situation. However, more often than not, friends and family would like to help you, but they don\\'t know how. Take the time to meet with friends and family members one at time to ask for help.It is important to be assertive when asking for help from friends and family. Try saying, \"I\\'m creating a weekly schedule for Mom\\'s care. Please let me know which two days you would like this week.\"\\nOffer a specific task if they don\\'t seem to know how to help.\\nIf you have children, then you might also consider asking a friend or family member to watch them for you one evening per week while you care for your parent. Be sure to let your children know why you need someone to watch them during these times.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" If your parent has become bedridden, it's likely you'll need some help from professional caregivers. If you're caring for the person at home, you can get help from people who come to the house. If the person will need long-term care, you may need to consider placing them in a facility that can provide care. If your parent has a terminal illness, hospice care may provide some relief.Both in-home care and care facilities can be expensive. Insurance and medicare may cover some in-home care (which sometimes includes in-home care at senior facilities).\\nHave a talk with your parent about getting some help. They may not like the idea much, as some people are reluctant to have outside help. If you need help persuading them, try asking someone who's been in a similar situation to help. It might also be hard for your parent to hear this from you. You might consider asking someone who has a different relationship with your parent to talk with them instead, such as a close friend, a cousin, or a spiritual leader.\\nYou can hire whatever level of care you need. For instance, some non-medical care can help with basics like bathroom assistance and meals. However, if your parent needs medical care, you will need to hire nurses or nursing aids to help, though that kind of care is generally prescribed by a doctor.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" When your parent is bedridden, you likely will have a surplus of emotions, which is perfectly normal. You may find you feel anger or resentment. You might feel guilty that you can't spend more time with them or that they're bedridden and you're not. You also may feel anxiety about the situation. Grief is also common, as you've lost who your parent was.Let yourself feel those emotions. Acknowledge them, and give yourself permission to feel them. Also, make sure you find someone to talk to. Anyone with a sympathetic ear will do.Writing down your feelings is also a good way to get them out and understand them better. Try keeping a journal as well.\\nYou can also talk with others who are facing the same issue. You can join a local support group or find one online. In fact, if your parent is on hospice, many hospice organizations have grief support groups available for people in your situation. Just knowing you're not alone can help.\\nProfessional counseling can also be beneficial. If your parent is bedridden, particularly if they have a terminal illness, it can be difficult to come to terms with that, especially if you have a complicated relationship with your parent. A professional can help you work through those feelings and come to terms with what's happening.\",\n",
       "  \" When it comes to a parent's failing health, you may find that having specific answers can somehow make the diagnosis more manageable. When you have questions about your parent's health, ask the doctors and nurses. If you don't understand their answer, ask them to explain it in layperson's terms. You deserve to know what's going on (with your parent's consent, of course).Taking notes or having another person there to help you remember everything during conversations with doctors and nurses can also be helpful. Emotions may be high, which might make it hard for you to remember everything.\\n\\n\",\n",

Whatever it is, take some time each day to do something you enjoy.Similarly, it's important to maintain the relationships in your life. Try to get away to spend time with people you care about, so you can just be you for a while.At the very least, set aside some time each day to return calls, respond to text messages, or check in with your other loved ones.\\nAlso, take time to escape. That is, sometimes, escaping into the fantasy world of a book, movie, or television show can give you the mental break you need. You can even enjoy these with your parent. Listening to your favorite music can also help you take a break.Be sure to schedule this time in. Don’t wait until you feel like you need a break.\\n\\n\",\n",

It is important to explore this dissatisfaction because this is the central aspect of every time we feel unhappy.;\\n\",\n",

Where a meal cooked by yourself or by someone you care for is a different experience.\\nConsider how much money was involved in the experience as this can affect the quality or value. There is a case where a person may hold the view have said that if you don\\'t charge for services, no one will appreciate its value.\\nWhat really happens however is that the cost paid for it dulls the experience, because the money itself has to be earned so it has its own relative cost to us as individuals. It returns to being a commodity as you are paying for it, therefore you have an expectation of your money (or ultimately, your efforts) getting what they are worth, or a return of investment. Both parts actually make quite special things seem very ordinary and unimportant and the experience of quality and sense of value is lost.\\nIt is important to consider however this exercise really is not about expecting people to do things for nothing, for the flipside is that when you value something, you are often more likely to bid higher for it to attain that goal.\\nAdditionally, many needed services just won\\'t exist without money to cover their costs, so the balance is between money making operations, or exploitative and the differences between them.\\nPart of the problem and indeed the solution is this same relative cost and return process.

This has a terrible cost to both sides.\\nThe alternative is when you do something for someone else, or vice versa (without any obligation or expectation, but just out of friendship, kindness or compassion), or share moments with people in a beneficial context it seems so much more precious and these are the memories that people cherish. This is because there is no physical or mental \"cost\" paid, or that the cost had a return of satisfaction.\\nThis is well reflected in people who follow a virtue system, volunteer their time or live a little more frugally within their economic means. The sacrifice of personal time and efforts, or practicing self control against our easier desires gives in effect a return of the investment of effort.\\nThese practitioners typically feel more satisfaction and more frequent satisfaction and so develop a sense of life-quality, but also appreciate things and people wisely and are consequently appreciated and valued by others.

As it is a central part of ordinary human interaction, it can't be avoided without becoming an recluse and that can make us cold and lonely when we shun others.\\nDiving in and sacrificing everything for others may make us vulnerable for the times when things don't go to plan.

As it is an effective method (after all, only until a person realizes they are being exploited will they know), so any extreme response leads into horror or misery, so less quality of life - people are resistant to change from outside, few will understand and even those that do are unlikely to implement difficult change.

       "  ' Depending on the crowd, you are going to want to use different types of music. In some situations you\\'ll want to use hymns like \"Be thou my vision\", in others you\\'ll want to use older songs like \"Every move I make\", in others you\\'ll want brand new songs like \"10,000 reasons\" or \"Our God is Greater\", and in some other situations you will want to combine all three. Generally this has to do with the people within the church and not the type of church it is, so go up to the pastor, worship leader, or some type of leader, and ask them to list off a few songs they normally play and base your song choice off of that.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' If you are playing for someone else who is speaking, which you probably will be, you will want to try to match your songs with the topic of the speaking. For instance, if the speaker is talking about how we should do everything as if we were doing it for Christ, you might want to play \"Every move I make\" or \"Jesus Paid it all\", or anything that is related to the words to be spoken.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" Once you have all the information about the types of songs you want to use, you are going to want to put all options into a list with their keys next to them. If you don't know the keys, look them up online and you should be able to find the key information, and if not, just guess what you think it might be in. Of course, if God told you any specific songs you will want to have those in their as well, even if they don't match the style of the church or the message.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' If you end up having too many songs for the time allotted, you will have to stop early and the set will sound unfinished. If you have too few songs, the set will sound awkward; you may have to fill time by playing again, one of the songs you already played! This is to be avoided at all costs. Find out how many songs you have time for, when you will be playing them, and whether or not they are split up. For example, the venue could tell you that you will be playing eight songs, so you set up those eight songs, but when you get there you find out you are playing four songs before the message and four songs after, which screws up the transitions you made for the 4th and 5th song.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' This is where the keys come in. Find songs that have the same, or close to the same, key. Example a song in B flat and a song in C are close enough together to be considered similar as you can change the key of one or even both of the songs without making any drastic changes. These songs will go together quite well, especially if they are in the same time signature. One thing that really makes worship awkward is when the worship team finishes a song, it becomes completely quiet, and the crowd starts hearing the movement of capos on guitars. you are going to want to make easy transitions, and this means either having the songs in the same key, or similar keys. Once you have the songs that go together, you are ready for the next step.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' While setting up the arrangement, you want to make sure you keep similar songs together, to make smooth transitions. If it\\'s not possible, don\\'t fret, it\\'s not that big of a deal. Once you are completely done with the arrangement of songs, move on to the next step. There are multiple ways to set up a set depending on how many songs you are playing and when you are playing them. You will want to play upbeat songs early, normal songs in the middle, and intimate songs towards the end. If you are playing a lot of songs, six or more, before the message, you will want to start off with upbeat songs that get people on their feet, like \"Sing Sing Sing\" by Chris Tomlin or \"Your Love Never Fails\" by Jesus Culture. Around halfway, get into a normal tempo like \"Better is One Day\", then towards the end drop down to intimate like \"This is The Air I Breathe\", or \"Prepare the Way\". If you are playing fewer songs before the message (four or five) you will want to keep the same structure, but keep it more on the upbeat side throughout. Don\\'t go all the way intimate. If you are playing just a couple songs before the message, (one to three) you will want to keep the same style throughout, preferably upbeat or normal. If you are playing many songs after the message, you will want to start off with an intimate feeling, then halfway through get all the way up to upbeat, then back down to normal or even intimate. If you are playing a few songs after the message, you will want to do the same structure as a lot of songs, but on the intimate side, meaning don\\'t have the upbeat songs. If you are playing just a couple of songs after the message, keep them the same tempo, preferably normal or intimate.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" Now, this whole thing changes a lot when your set is split up like the example above. If you are playing a lot of songs both before and after, play upbeat songs up front, then slow down to more normal songs towards the middle, then speed up right before the message to upbeat. After the message, start off with some really slow intimate songs, speed up to normal, and end with intimate. This is at variance with the prior step. The reason you want to do this is because, if you are playing more than six songs before and after the message, you risk tiring out your crowd's attention span. So you need to mix it up. If you go to see a band play live, notice that they throw in some random really upbeat or really intimate songs so you keep listening, and you want this same thing in worship, because, otherwise, they will stop worshipping. If you are playing a few songs before, start with upbeat and end with normal. The rest of the information is the same as above.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" You want to keep the music flowing from one song to the next, and not have any sudden stops. When the next song is in the same key, keep playing the chord progression on an acoustic guitar very lightly and then change the progression according to the next song and continue. If two adjoining songs aren't in the same key, you can possibly make it sound like they are in the same key, for instance if you are playing a song in C and are changing to a song in G, you can keep playing C and G over and over again as they are in both C key and G key, then change to the G progression and it won't be at all noticeable unless your a musician. Even if there is just one note that's the same within the two keys, you might be able to have your guitarist keep playing that note and then continue in the next key once someone starts playing the new chord progression. Another way is to have the drummer keep playing and then have the rest of the band join in after changing keys. This can sound great if done right. If none of those are possibilities, have someone on your team pray or give a brief message while someone else starts playing the new chords. The audience will pay attention to the voice and not the music.\\n\\n\",\n",

Action begins at the local level, so find opportunities to volunteer around town. In Fascism, what is good for the community is good for the People and the State.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Fascism rejects electoral democracy, because it sees democracy as simply enabling politicians to lie to the people to get in power, and thus the leaders do not truly represent the People. Instead, Fascism believes in putting together a system where those fit to rule ensure that power stays in the right hands, and so power is passed through a dynastic or oligarchic system. Understand that in a Fascist country, you will not always get to vote for your leader, but your voice can still be heard in public forum meetings or referendums, for example.\\n\\n',\n",

Instead of class warfare Fascism believes in class collaboration - the different classes must all work together to help strengthen their community and their State. Fascism advocates a mixed economy where people can own property and open their own businesses, but major corporations must always be answerable to the will of the State, and must always serve the common good of the People.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'How to Avoid Temptation to Sin': [' Everyone has their own temptations. Though Jesus never sinned, even he was tempted to. (Hebrews 4:15) Spend a few moments self-reflecting to identify your personal temptations. Then, pin down the personality traits that lead you to temptation - maybe you\\'re insecure or you\\'re never satisfied with yourself. Perhaps you prioritize pleasure over responsibility. No two people are exactly alike. Your temptations might resemble those of your friends, family, or other associates, but there\\'s also a chance that they\\'re unique to you. A priest, counselor, or other trusted person can help you discover your unique temptations and the flaws from which these temptations developed.\\n\\nIf you\\'re having a hard time defining exactly what your temptations are, begin by pinpointing the things in your life that make you sad, then try to find a thought process or habit you possess that leads to these things. For instance, let\\'s say you\\'re in a committed relationship with a woman you love but you frequently feel intense guilt because you flirt with other women. Search your heart. Ask yourself, \"what do I think or do that makes me want to act like this?\" After some reflection, you may find, for instance, that you\\'re worried about whether you\\'re still attractive. The source of your temptation in this case is your sense of insecurity.;\\n',\n",
       "  ' Your aim when fighting temptation should take into account the fact that, as a human being, you\\'re incapable of perfection. Don\\'t set an un-achievable goal like \"I will never sin again.\" If you do, you\\'re setting yourself up for disappointment. Realize that you will inevitably sin again (and again and again). Set a realistic goal that takes this into account. ]\\n\\n\\nFor instance, if you\\'ve been neglecting your child\\'s vocal recitals in favor of nights spent at home watching TV, you might set a goal of never missing another vocal recital (except for emergencies) and of reducing your time spent watching TV every week by four hours. This goal is well within your grasp.\\nFor a few very serious sins, it is absolutely necessary to set a zero-tolerance goal - for instance, you should obviously never commit murder or marital infidelity. These sins can cause irreparable damage to others\\' lives.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" You were blessed with free will for a reason. Don't waste your opportunity to act decisively against your personal temptation by giving into the separate temptation of inaction! Stand up and take action now. Make it your goal going forward to not give in to your temptation. The hardest part of overcoming your temptation can be getting started. Don't sabotage your journey before it's begun by telling yourself you can't do it.\\n\\n\\nWhen Jesus died, he gave us authority over the forces of evil. (Mark 16:17) Never fear or run from the forces of evil in your own life. With hard work and sincere faith, nothing is beyond your grasp.\\n\\n\",\n",

The only right path is forward, towards righteousness. If your past is marked by sin, acknowledge your mistakes without excessive guilt. Build upon your past mistakes. Strive never to make your old mistakes again. Even if you relapse, you\\'ll have made progress away from your sinful past.\\n\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t already, sincerely ask God for forgiveness. God is infinite in his capacity to forgive. In his eyes, once you are forgiven, it\\'s as if you had never committed sin in the first place: \"And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.\" (Hebrews 10:17)\\n\\n',\n",

If you're frequently persuaded by certain friends to commit acts of vandalism, don't hang out with these friends. By distancing yourself from the people and things associated with your sin, you're eliminating opportunities for sin and giving yourself less chances to fail.\\n\\n\\nGenerally, it's a good idea to help other people work through their own sins. However, if you're struggling with the pull of your own temptations, sinful people can make it difficult to escape. Wait until you have your temptations under control before returning to help these people with their own sins.\\nEliminate the sources of temptation from your home.

For instance, kick out a roommate who frequently convinces you to neglect your responsibilities.\\n\\n\",\n",

Devote yourself to your job or your studies by taking extra hours or signing up to be a tutor, for instance. Spend time learning an instrument or a new language. If you have lots of free time, do anything you can to fill your time with activities that can help you grow closer to God, or that make you a healthier, richer, or better person.\\n\\n\\nIf you\\'re struggling to think of things that you can do to occupy your time, a good place to start is at a local homeless shelter, crisis center, or community outreach center.

This doesn\\'t mean that you\\'re better off giving up! Fight your temptations tooth and nail. Don\\'t quit, even if you suffer setbacks or relapses. The more persistently you fight, the better chance you\\'ll have of beating your temptation.\\n\\n\\nNever reward yourself with sinful \"allowances\" or \"breaks.\" Resist the slippery slope of instant gratification. This instant gratification can act deceitfully, causing you to feel that it\\'s not wrong, although it is in God\\'s eyes.\\nTreat your temptations like bad habits that you must break.

It's also inevitable that we will give in to this urge at some point. However, it's possible, through our efforts, to reduce the hold that temptation has over us.

Many dangerous microbes are difficult to grow and cultivate, while still others are fragile and die when exposed to air or light. Know the most common delivery methods for bioterrorism agents (listed below) so that, in the event of an attack, you will be better prepared to protect yourself.\\n\\n\\nFood and water contamination: Certain bioterrorism agents can persist in food and water, especially if consumed unheated. Thoroughly cooking food and boiling water can help kill these pathogens.\\nAnimal transmission: Some animals, especially pests like mosquitoes and ticks, can be vectors for deadly diseases. Keeping pest-control agents (insecticides, etc.) is a smart choice to protect against this dispersal method.\\nPerson-to-person transmission: Diseases like smallpox spread extremely contagiously simply from person-to-person contact. In these cases, physically staying away from infected people (via quarantine, for instance) is the best move.\\nAerosol transmission: In perhaps the most dangerous method of transmission, a few bioterrorism agents (like anthrax) can be converted to a fine mist and spread through the air, where they can drift for miles and cause infection upon inhalation. In this case, closing windows and doors and using a proper gas mask can help prevent infection.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'How to Buy a Toilet': [\" When you flush a standard toilet, the handle pulls up a chain, which raises a flush valve. This flush valve then releases at least two gallons (about 7.5 litres) of water from the tank into the bowl in about three seconds, which triggers the siphon to suck the contents of the bowl down the drain and into a sewer system or septic tank. However, contrary to popular belief, the tank is not the most important part of a toilet's technology. In fact, you could detach the tank from the toilet and pour two gallons of water into the bucket by hand, and the toilet would still flush.;\\n\",\n",
       "  \" This type is the most common type in North America. These toilets use the weight and height of the water in the tank to facilitate a flush. The tank then refills via a small gushing pipe (usually plastic) until a float shuts off the flow. If any water does happen to flow a little higher from gushing, hand-motion inside, or even an earthquake, a narrow overflow tube handles any overflow problems. So, as long as the toilet is functioning properly, no water should spill outside of the porcelain tank. This type is the staple toilet, simple, effective, and durable.The flushing sound for gravity assisted toilets also isn't particularly loud and they are easy to repair. However, if you have a lot of people using your toilet (say, a large family) or are going to be putting a lot of wear on the toilet's flush system, gravity-assisted toilets may not have enough power to flush consistently, after every use.Think about purchasing a standard gravity-assisted toilet if you have a small family or a bathroom that will be getting minimal use.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' Unlike gravity assisted, pressure-assisted toilets have an ‘active’ rather than a passive mechanism. This type adds pressure to the force of gravity by supplying more force than the traditional unit. Water displaces air inside a sealed cylindrical tank, usually made of metal or plastic, inside the larger ceramic tank, helping to generate a larger force.However, because the water in the tank is held under pressure, it flushes with greater force, resulting in a loud flushing sound. As well, a greater amount of pressure via your toilet can put stress on older pipes and plumbing in your home, which can lead to a leak or a busted pipe.Go for a pressure-assisted toilet if you live in a newer building or a home with new, well kept pipes, and low water pressure.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" This type innovates on the standard gravity-assisted toilet by using a vacuum that draws the water with more force into the bowl using the rim holes in the upper toilet bowl. Vacuum-assisted toilets have a cleaner, quieter flush than other models, making them ideal for a bathroom near your bedroom, or by a quiet area of your home. However, unclogging this type of toilet requires some time and skill. To unplug the bowl, you have to take the lid off and put your hand over an opening in the tank for the plunging action to work. The vacuum-assisted toilet also costs about $100 more than a gravity toilet.\\n\\n\\nThink about getting this type if you're looking for a toilet with quiet but powerful flushing, and are willing to spend some extra money up front.\\n\\n\",\n",

Power-assisted toilets can also save the average family 2,000 gallons of water per year.

In fact, studies have shown that a dual-flush toilet uses an average of just 6.9 gallons per day, compared to 9.5 gallons of a low-flow toilet and 19 gallons with the older models.

Take a supplement targeted at your age group with breakfast each morning, and try to incorporate certain foods into your diet. Here are some specific suggestions:\\n\\n\\nMake sure to take in an abundance of carbohydrates and calories for that is where the body gains its energy to grow.\\nGet plenty of calcium (found in dairy products and green vegetables). Calcium promotes bone growth and can help prevent osteoporosis.\\nTaking 500 mg of niacin has shown to significantly increase growth hormone levels only when taken on an empty stomach.\\nGet sufficient vitamin D (which can be obtained through eating fish, alfalfa, or mushrooms, or spending enough time in the sun). Vitamin D promotes bone and muscle growth in children, and a deficiency has been shown to stunt growth and cause weight gain in teenage girls. If you don't like fish, consider a purified fish oil supplement (purifying removes mercury).\\nTake in a lots of lean protein (from meat, cheese, eggs, beans, tofu, seeds, or legumes). Proteins provide an essential building block your body needs in order to grow. At least one (preferably two) of your meals each day should include a high-quality protein.\\nIf you think that the amount of protein in your diet is low then take protein powder once or twice a day.\\nUp your zinc intake (oysters, chocolate, peanuts, eggs, peas, asparagus, and supplements). A zinc deficiency can cause stunted growth in children . The best way to make sure you meet your body's daily need is by taking a vitamin or supplement that includes zinc.\\nEat on a regular schedule. You should be eating 3 meals a day, with small snacks between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner. Try to schedule these events at roughly the same time each day. 4-5 hours is the time needed for insulin to disappear from your bloodstream so that growth hormone can work on building your tissue. This is the period of time that you should wait between meals. Proteins, which are absorbed slowly, should keep you from becoming hungry. Your last meal should be 3-4 hours before you go to sleep. Small amount of protein shake are allowed right before your bedtime.\\nEat a steady amount of food. That's why dieting is not recommended as long as you're still growing. Not eating a good quantity of food will deprive your body of the substances detailed above, therefore stunting your growth. If you want to lose weight, decrease the amount of fats, sugar, and carbohydrates from your alimentation\\xa0, but eat the rest of the foods in good, moderate amounts. Also, try losing weight through sports. After all, you can still lose weight later, but you must take the most out of your adolescence if you want to grow taller.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" Some childhood illnesses can stunt your growth. Most of them can be avoided by the routine immunizations you may have had as a baby, but stay on the safe side by ingesting plenty of Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruits, and lemons) and getting plenty of rest as soon as you notice that you feel sick.\\n\\n\\nKeep your immune system strong by eating whole, fresh foods. Try to avoid processed foods, foods with empty calories or high levels of fat, and hydrogenated foods, such as margarine or shortening.\\nEat a wide variety of healthy foods. Eating one thing such as açaí berries or salmon for every meal, while not harmful, doesn't do all that much to keep your immune system at its strongest. Eat a variety of fruits, plenty vegetables, whole grains, protein sources such as milk, cheese, nuts and fish, and other foods rich in antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids for a healthier immune system. Water is the basic solvent for all the products of digestion. It is essential for removing waste from our bodies and 6 to 8 glasses daily is considered healthy.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Stretching is the most effective form of exercising when it comes to height increase. Doing intense stretching exercises can add a few extra inches to your height, even short after growth has stopped. For best results, you should do these exercise two times a day, after you wake up and before you go to bed. Start with easy exercises, then gradually move on to the more difficult ones.\\nTickle Massage. This works best if somebody else does it for you: Massage your knee for 5-10 minutes. This should be very ticklish to some others. Massaging your knees with your hands allows your knees to release growth chemicals that helps you grow your bones.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

If you stand up straight, your bones will grow straight, and you won\\'t get osteoporosis, which will obviously make you look shorter. So when you stand up and sit up straighter, not only will you look taller, but you will feel taller, and maybe even be taller.\\n\\n\\nTry the Alexander technique for better posture. Used by trained singers and actors, the Alexander technique improves posture by employing what the founder of the technique, F. Matthias Alexander, called \"good use of the body.\" Classes teaching the technique are popular.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \" If you come from a tall family and you're not growing by your mid-teens, or if your height hasn't changed much from before puberty to during puberty, then it's a good idea to see a doctor. Conditions that can stunt your growth (such as human growth hormone deficiency or autoimmune diseases) are fairly rare, but they do exist. If you're eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of rest, but you're still not growing, then it's time to consult a doctor.\\n\\n\\nConsider seeing a doctor, if you're a short adult. Though there are several childhood conditions (such as rickets) that can result in a short height as an adult, you should still ask a doctor about it. There may be ways to make sure that your bones and organs are healthy, even though you didn't grow to your full height.\\n\\n\"],\n",

If you are unsure about how to do it, ask for help or a demonstration to make sure it is done properly.\\n\\n\\nInstall the system in a location that is close to the water faucet. UV light is only effective for the water that passes through it. If that water then carries on through the contaminated pipes, it will become contaminated again.

It is also recommended to clean the glass around the lamp that may have collected mineral deposits.If the lamp intensity decreases too much, it will no longer be effective against microorganisms and your water will not be sterilized.

If the sky is partly cloudy or half-filled with clouds it can take up to two days for sterilization to be complete.Make sure the bottle is on its side and not standing upright.

Instead, prioritize sleeping at least seven to nine hours a night.\\n\\n\\nLack of sleep can also lead to burn out, which can be detrimental to your grades once finals start at the end of spring semester.Lack of sleep can increase chances for increased anxiety and depression as well.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" Although you may need to cram for an exam before a test or work on a paper before it's due, try not to pull an all-nighter. This can mess up your sleep routine and cause you to get behind on your normal sleep schedule.\\n\\n\\nIf you can't avoid pulling an all-nighter, use naps throughout the next day or go to bed early the next night to help decrease your sleep debt.Be aware that studying through the night is not an effective way to study — sleep is a vital part of memory retention, in particular when converting short-term memories into long-term ones.So, if you do remember what you studied for the exam, chances are you will forget it in the long-term.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' If you are having trouble syncing up your sleep schedule with your roommate, have a talk with them. Come to an agreement that will benefit your both. This can include studying in a common space once you go to bed, using headphone to cut down on music or video noise, or using smaller lamps on their side of the room.',\n",
       "  ' It may be tempting to try to do everything on campus or join every after school organization; however, this can cause problems with your health and grades. If you overextend yourself, you are at larger risk of getting sick. Only take on what you can feasibly do while maintaining your sleep schedule, health, and GPA.This can be even harsher during spring semester because the break you have between semesters is shorter than summer break.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  ' Although going to the coffee shop with your friends can be fun, drinking too much caffeine can cause you to be too jittery to sleep. Sugary beverages can have the same effect. This can cause you to lose sleep over time, which can be detrimental to your health.\\n\\n\\nTry to drink decaffeinated coffee or use all natural non-sugary sweeteners.'],\n",
       " 'How to Maintain Healthy Kidneys': [\" Most Americans don't drink enough water during the day, which probably has the biggest negative impact on their kidneys. Being the high-volume filters that they are, the kidneys need adequate water to remove toxins, waste products and unwanted or unneeded compounds from the blood. As such, drinking plenty of water at regular intervals throughout the day will help your kidneys function properly and not get too congested or calcified.Aim for four to six 8-ounce glasses of water a day if you're sedentary, or eight glasses if you're more active or live in a warm climate.During hot summer months or when exercising strenuously, you need to drink more water than usual to make up for fluid lost by perspiring.\\nYour urine should be fairly clear or straw-colored when you go to the bathroom. If it's any darker than that, then it may be a sign you are dehydrated.\\nCaffeinated beverages (coffee, black tea, soda pop) obviously contain water, but caffeine is diuretic and triggers frequent urination, so they are not great sources of hydration. Stick with filtered water and natural fruit/veggie juices.;\\n\",\n",
       "  \" As noted above, high blood pressure is damaging to blood vessels throughout the body, including the small arteries within the kidneys that are so important for its filtrating ability. As such, keep your blood pressure at a target set by your doctor, which is typically less than 140/90 mm Hg.Blood pressure below this level can help delay or prevent kidney dysfunction and failure.\\n\\n\\nCheck your blood pressure regularly, either at your local pharmacy, health clinic, or at home with some purchased equipment. Hypertension often has no obvious symptoms, so you need to keep on eye on your numbers.\\nEating a low-salt diet, reducing stress and maintaining a healthy weight all help maintain normal blood pressure.\\nIf lifestyle changes don't make a big impact, then blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be able to protect your kidneys by reducing your blood pressure.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" In addition to watching your calories, getting regular cardiovascular exercise is a great way to maintain your weight, which fosters kidney health. Obesity strains the heart and blood vessels, which leads to higher blood pressure and eventual kidney damage.. Just 30 minutes of mild-to-moderate cardiovascular exercise on a daily basis is associated with better kidney health as it can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as trigger weight loss. Start by simply walking around your neighborhood (if it's safe), then transition to more challenging terrain with some hills. Treadmills and cycling are also great for cardiovascular exercise.\\n\\n\\nAvoid vigorous exercise to start with, especially if you've been diagnosed with a heart issue. Vigorous exercise (such as long-distance running) temporarily increases blood pressure, which strains the kidneys and heart.\\nThirty minutes of exercise five times a week is a good start, and an hour is even better (for most people), but much more time spent exercising doesn't appear to be significantly more beneficial.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  ' A healthy, low-salt diet is healthy for the kidneys because it keeps blood pressure in check. For the most part, fresh fruits and veggies are low in sodium, high in vitamins and minerals, and a good source of antioxidants, which is all beneficial for the cardiovascular system and the kidneys.Fruits and veggies are also good sources of water, which the kidneys need to properly filtrate the blood.\\n\\n\\nVeggies that contain moderate amounts of sodium include artichokes, beets, carrots, seaweed, turnips and celery — so go easy on these.\\nFruits that have a little more sodium than average include tropical mammy apples, guavas and passion fruits.\\nCanned and pickled vegetables are usually high in sodium and should be avoided or minimized in your diet.\\nFruits and veggies especially rich in antioxidants include: all dark-colored berries, strawberries, apples, cherries, artichokes, kidney and pinto beans.\\n\\n',\n",
       "  \" The standard American diet is not only too high in sodium, but it's usually deficient in a variety of essential nutrients (certain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids). Eating a nutritious diet certainly reduces the risk of experiencing any nutritional deficiencies, but supplementing can be beneficial and make up for any gaps in your diet. Supplements that have demonstrated to be beneficial to kidney health in studies include vitamin D, potassium, coenzyme Q10 and omega-3 fatty acids.Clinical trials conducted on chronic kidney disease patients concluded that vitamin D supplements improved kidney and heart function.Remember that our skin can make vitamin D in response to intense summer sunshine.\\nThe sodium-potassium balance in the kidneys is crucial for proper function, so adding more potassium to your diet (via foods or supplements) helps to reduce the negative effects of high sodium levels.Coenzyme Q10 helps normalize blood pressure and decrease hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, both strong risk factors for kidney disease.Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation helps to decrease the prevalence of chronic kidney disease by reducing blood pressure and excess protein in the urine.\",\n",
       "  \" It's no secret that over-indulging in alcoholic beverages (which contain ethanol, a carcinogen) is strongly associated with numerous types of cancer and organ damage, including the kidneys.Ethanol damages the delicate internal structures of the kidneys, making them less able to filter your blood and balance fluids / electrolytes — frequently leading to high blood pressure.\\n\\n\\nBinge drinking (about 4-5 drinks within a couple of hours) can raise blood alcohol levels to the point that the kidneys essentially shut down — a condition called acute kidney injury.As such, either stop drinking alcohol entirely or limit your consumption to no more than 1 alcoholic beverage per day.\\nThe least harmful alcoholic beverage is considered to be red wine because it contains antioxidants, such as resveratrol, which can help prevent free radical damage of blood vessels and other tissues.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" All medications are toxic to organs such as the liver and kidneys at least to some extent (dosage is obviously an important factor too), but some are much more damaging than others. For example, common over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin are well known to cause kidney damage if they are taken regularly over a prolonged period of time.The byproducts of their breakdown within the body can easily damage the kidneys and liver.\\n\\n\\nIf your kidneys are otherwise healthy, then occasional use of these medicines for inflammation and pain control is probably fine, but keep continuous use to less than 2 weeks and dosages under 800 mg daily.\\nIf you're taking anti-inflammatories on a long-term basis for arthritis or other chronic conditions, ask your doctor about monitoring your kidney function via certain blood and urine tests.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" The typical American diet is relatively high in salt, which is comprised of sodium and chloride. Too much sodium inhibits your kidneys from filtering and excreting water, which builds up in the body and increases blood pressure.High blood pressure (hypertension) creates turbulence within the kidney's small blood vessels, which leads to damage and dysfunction. As such, avoid high-sodium foods and stop using the salt shaker during meals.\\n\\n\\nYou should consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day if your kidneys are healthy, and less than 1,500 mg if you have kidney dysfunction or high blood pressure.Avoid or limit consumption of foods high in sodium, such as: processed meats, crackers, salted nuts and snacks, canned soups, pickled foods, frozen foods and most processed condiments and dressings.Consider adopting some form of DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet that's based on low sodium foods, such as fresh fruits and veggies.\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  \" Protein is obviously an essential macronutrient needed to build muscle tissue, skin, enzymes and many other compounds in the body. However, high-protein diets tend to be hard on the kidneys because they must work harder to filter all the protein and amino acids out of the bloodstream.Furthermore, high-protein diets may worsen kidney function in people with kidney disease because their bodies often have trouble eliminating the waste products of protein metabolism.The amount of dietary protein that's healthy for you and your kidneys depends on your body size, muscle mass and activity levels. Men need more protein than women, and athletes need more than people who are sedentary.\\nIn general, the average-sized adult needs between 46 to 56 g of protein daily, depending on their weight, muscle mass and overall health.Healthy sources of protein include beans, most soy products, unsalted nuts, hemp seeds, fish, skinless poultry.\\n\\n\"],\n",
