      "[\"Sell yourself first. Before doing anything else, stop and sum up yourself as an artist. Now, think about how to translate that to an online profile. Be it the few words, Twitter allows you or an entire page of indulgence that your own website would allow you. Bring out the most salient features of your creativity, your experience, your passion, and your reasons for painting. Make it clear to readers why you are an artist who loves art, produces high quality art, and is a true champion of art. If you're not great with words, find a friend who can help you with this really important aspect of selling online – the establishment of your credibility and reliability.\", 'Join online artist communities. Depending on what scale you intend to sell your art pieces, you may want to get an account on an online art community or store, like Deviant Art. With 15% -20 % brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search). Read the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales. If your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.', 'Make yourself public. Get yourself out there as best as you can by advertising yourself. Publish some \"example\" pieces around the web to show what you can do and to demonstrate your style. Be sure to add a watermark to your digital version to protect your artwork from art thieves. Spend a little time researching online the ways in which other artists are promoting themselves. What works for them and what doesn\\'t? What do you like about their promotional strategies and what do you want to avoid? This type of research can give you a lot of ideas and also alert you to potential pitfalls for the ways in which you will promote your own artwork. Bookmark the sites of artists selling online that really inspire you, so that you can come back to them regularly to see how they\\'re evolving and succeeding. Seize the power of Twitter and Facebook to increase people\\'s knowledge of you. Tweet updates about your new paintings, your thoughts about art, and news items about art in general. On Facebook, place photos of your artwork, (digitally watermarked), photos of you receiving awards, and information about your art, artwork in general, and perhaps even some critiques of artwork.', 'Blog about your artwork. Given the hundreds of free blogging websites, you have a lot of choice in keeping a blog. Most importantly, it\\'s extremely useful to keep it updated regularly - this gives people something \"pretty to look at\", and a story to follow as your reputation increases and your sales story grows. A blog can pick up a lot of hits from search engines if you utilize the keywords feature accurately; use it to your advantage. Be sure to name your blog something simple but memorable – you\\'ll want people to be able to find you with ease. Read How to start a blog and How to increase website traffic for free for assistance. A good way to test keywords for very little cost is through using an auction site. Play around with the words you use to title your art sales, as well as the words used within the body of the text. Keep changing the words until you find the sweet spot – words that really do seem to attract the most views.', \"Create a mailing list. This could be your most effective tool if managed well. For every sale you make, every person who sends you an email that might be interested, get all of their email addresses in digital database ready for mass emailing. At designated intervals (once a month, every other week, whenever you start a new series) send them all nice, grammatically correct, friendly emails, complete with a neatly set-out portfolio of the pictures of your recent work (a PDF can work well for this purpose). This keeps you on the radar of past customers, which is important. And if it's a really wonderful newsletter, you might get lucky and they might send it to all of their friends as well – then even more eyes are seeing your work! Every thoughtful mailing list includes an opt-out option. Don't be threatened by this; see it as good housekeeping and as retaining the clients who really do want to see your items. You're not online to hassle people who aren't interested!\", 'Take good pictures. Like they say, \"a picture\\'s worth a thousand words\" and you\\'ll want your impression on potential customers to be good. Show detail, right down to paint strokes and paint type. Be willing to show potential buyers multiple shots of your work under different light, hung on a wall, etc. This may be the only way to alleviate the justifiable fear many people have of buying a work of art that they have never seen in person. Bear in mind that not everyone has a good internet connection. Balance great photos with ease of downloading time. Talk to a web specialist if you\\'re not sure what to do. For more photography tips of relevance, read How to take better product photographs for free and How to take catalog photos.', 'Be sure to properly license your art. Licensing art is a way of proving what belongs to whom. It is a necessary bookkeeping in the arts department and will help you if there is a dispute about originality, ownership, or moral rights.', \"Consider the option of creating your own site. Having your own site means that you can optimize every page for search engines and it sets you apart from the many artists who only use general art sales sites. Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.). If you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com. Give serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment. Add prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion. When creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.\", \"Expect this to be a gradual process and don't expect to sell a lot right away. An online art business needs to be built up little by little. It's much the same as putting together a company (indeed, you should treat your online art sales as a business) – you will try to make your name known, or at least give people a hint on who you are as an artist, develop your services as you grow, and gain in reputation as time goes on. It may feel like a long time at the beginning but solid and patient foundations will set you up for a good future, as well as maintaining a positive attitude about what you're doing. Attend as many relevant art shows to show your work as you can. If the shows are juried, display the awards your art has won as part of your profiles or website backgrounds.\"]\n"

       "  (\"Consider the option of creating your own site. Having your own site means that you can optimize every page for search engines and it sets you apart from the many artists who only use general art sales sites. Having your own website means that the viewer is not distracted by other artists and their work whilst browsing your art and your own name is likely to gain in reputation faster. You can sell directly from your site via email correspondence with potential buyers (ask them to contact you for prices, to make a purchase etc.). If you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com. Give serious consideration to making your website as much like a virtual art gallery as possible. Encourage potential clients to wander through and see your paintings in a leisurely, gallery-like manner to increase their viewing enjoyment. Add prices and contact details. People want to see the price, so don't hide it or expect the customer to come up with one for you. And be available to answer their questions in a timely fashion. When creating your own website, you need to find a secure method for accepting payment and you might even consider implementing an escrow system. The more expensive your artwork is, the more careful you will need to be about money handling, including acceptance of returns and refunds. There are various methods in existence online for the safe transference of money; do your research to find out what works best for your local needs and for your global market.\",\n",

If you're serious about selling your art online with your own site, then it's essential with a domain name that is either your own name or the name that you want people to associate you with your art. For example, you could use a domain made up of your first and last name such as firstnamelastname.com or if you work under a pseudonym then you could use a domain name using that i.e. pseudonym.com.

Be it the few words, Twitter allows you or an entire page of indulgence that your own website would allow you. Bring out the most salient features of your creativity, your experience, your passion, and your reasons for painting. Make it clear to readers why you are an artist who loves art, produces high quality art, and is a true champion of art. If you're not great with words, find a friend who can help you with this really important aspect of selling online – the establishment of your credibility and reliability.\",\n",
       "  'Join online artist communities. Depending on what scale you intend to sell your art pieces, you may want to get an account on an online art community or store, like Deviant Art. With 15% -20 % brokerage, you can also find many online art galleries like Art Brokerage, Diva Art Group, or Saatchi Art that will show your artwork online and sell them to the buyer in completely secured transaction. There are also many other possible sites, such as Etsy (heavier on the crafts but still arty), eBay (auction site), an Amazon store (an online store platform), CafePress (for printing your artwork onto stuff like mugs), Craigslist (general classifieds), and quite a lot of other artwork based sales sites (do a general search). Read the terms and conditions of every site very carefully. Know what commission or percentage the site takes, know what protections (or lack of them) that the site offers, know what clientele generally peruse the site, know the general sales brought in by the site, know everything you can that is relevant to your sales. If your goal is to turn your art into an investment property, then selling online is likely to be a much longer path to this end. This is largely because it is generally more difficult for unknown artists to secure higher priced sales with serious collectors online than it is through a traditional gallery where such concrete decisions can be made safely. It is best to see selling art online as an adjunct to your usual methods of selling art, not your only means.',\n",

       " 'How to Pick a Stage Name1': ['Understand what a stage name can do for you. A stage name can help you accomplish a number of things, which all can influence how you decide on your name. Branding: A stage name can help you brand your performance persona, giving you a separate identity to develop as a brand. Separation of personal and professional life: A stage name will be a very public name, possibly a household name. While some people might still know your real name, keeping your real name separate from your stage name can afford you some level of privacy. Differentiation: If your real name is very common, a stage name can help you stand out and be more memorable. Prejudice considerations: Some people have used stage names in the past in order to decrease immediate reactions of racism, anti-Semitism or other forms of prejudice. Luckily, this is less often the case today. Similarly, some women may have avoided a hyphenated name because it might indicate they’re married, which unfortunately some consider to be detrimental to their careers.',\n",

       "  'Have a story behind your name. Whatever your stage name, people will likely want to know how you decided to call yourself that. If it’s an uninteresting story, then perhaps think about making up a more exciting story to go with your name.',\n",
       "  'Do research about your name. Look online and in name books to learn the meaning of the name you’ve chosen. Learn the history of the name. Does the name’s meaning and history reflect what you want it to mean?',\n",
       "  'Choose a searchable name. Think about how people can find your name through search engines like Google. If you use very common words, especially single words like Trouble or Heart, it may be hard for fans to find you online.',\n",
       "  'Choose a name that will grow with you. There can be the appeal of choosing a name that reflects the moment, where you might follow a fad. Also consider where you want to be in 10 or 20 years. Does your stage name suit an older performer just as well as a younger one? Child performers should consider how their names will grow with them as they get older. Joe Yule called himself Mickey Rooney, a good name for a kid actor. But it was less useful as an adult actor. Similarly Lil’ Bow Wow had to drop “Lil” when he grew up.Choose a name that you won’t get tired of quickly.

Sorry, but that doesn't work for actors or models, so why on earth should it work for burlesque performers. Yes, it's good to post on Facebook, but also, contact those shows you listed in the previous step and ask about getting booked.

Being called by the muse is a wonderful thing, without a doubt, but without the technical abilities to realize your vision, you won't get very far. Whatever your chosen medium or media, become an expert in every part of it. Set aside an hour or more each day to devote to nothing but practicing your technique. Focus especially on those areas that are the weakest for you, but build your strengths as well. Take advantage of the communities and resources that you can find. Artist supply manufacturers, and art stores themselves, often have free literature, tutorials, videos, and websites that are loaded with tips, techniques, and more. Some stores even offer weekend training seminars, where you can not only pick up some new skills, you'll also meet other artists.\",\n",
       "  \"Work on the things you love. Choose one subject that is meaningful to you and that you want to be able to draw well. Start with a still life, or a photo that's yours, in public domain, or that you have permission to use. Draw or paint that same photo over and over, using different approaches—paint, pencil, abstract, realism—whatever moves you. Build up from easy subjects, like a rubber ball or a rectangular block, to more complicated, difficult subject, like a rose, a clear glass marble or a shiny metal bowl. And try to get the details right: the curves of a petal, the clarity of the glass, or reflections so good that Escher would be impressed! Each of them will improve your ability to draw in general. Practice timed gesture drawing. Pick your subject, set your timer for two or three minutes, start drawing, then stop when the timer goes off, even if the drawing isn't finished. Set the timer again and start over. Doing 10 three minute drawings will give you more skill than taking half an hour to draw the same thing in detail.\",\n",
       "  \"Vary the art tools you use. Start off with a pencil, then go to charcoal, colored pencils, pastels, paint, whatever interests you. Never fear trying new tools or techniques. When trying an expensive new medium, visit Dick Blick or Jerry's Artarama and email them for samples. Many types of art suppliers make sample sized products or the company will send out just one stick or a small piece of the expensive paper or canvas for you to test before deciding what to buy. This gives you a chance to try it first and see if you like it. Try more than one brand—the samples are usually not the same color and you can find out which brand to invest in by those trials.\",\n",

If they don\\'t, you\\'re still on the right track: if several people think your technique is great, but your subject matter leaves something to be desired, that\\'s an opportunity for self-reflection and to learn something. Don\\'t confuse critique with personal criticism, especially if the critic is somebody who is not interested in seeing you become an artist.',\n",
       "  \"Look outside your circle for opinions. Look for critique from people who draw better than you do. Make friends online with real artists whose work you admire.

The better you get at art, the easier it is for people to compliment you and call you talented. Compliments can sometimes be critiques, and those are very valuable!

Like visiting galleries, this will help place you in the community, and Facebook can reach well beyond your neighborhood. Tweet about art regularly. Your art, historical art, pop art, any art at all. The more you know about art, the more you'll be recognized as somebody worth paying attention to. At the same time, follow artists and galleries, and respond to their tweets.

Many artists fall a little bit in love with their subject, whether it be a bowl of fruit or the artist\\'s model. If you like expressing anger and dark emotions, study dark painters. If you like abstracts and splatter paintings, study them and do them—they take their own techniques and don\\'t just happen because someone threw paint at a canvas and called it art.

As you style grows and changes, older paintings you've done become more valuable. Collectors will be interested in the entire history of your life's work.

Restaurant eating accounted for the largest portion of America's discretionary spending in 2009, eating up $392 billion. Often, a large part of what is spent on food is more about entertainment than to provide appropriate nutrition. Instead of making “going out to dinner” a family activity, make cooking dinner together at home the evening's entertainment. Home cooked food is much less expensive and can be a lot more fun! Some entertaining ways to cook at home include: Baking and decorating cookies or a cake with younger children. Kids love to ice and decorate cookies and cakes. Buy plenty of sprinkles, colored icings, and small candies and let them go to work. Teaching older children a family recipe by preparing it together. Many older children are interested in learning how to prepare family favorites, and what better way to learn than by preparing them together? Making individual or personal pizzas. Using bagels, flour tortillas, French bread, or pizza dough, make a personal size pizza for each family member and allow everyone to top their own pies from a selection of vegetables, cheeses, meats, etc. Experimenting with new things. For example, if you have always been interested in Indian cuisine, use curry in your cooking. Find new ways to prepare favorite vegetables or test out new recipes. Whatever your passion, explore it with your family by preparing a meal or a snack. You could have each night of the week follow a theme such as Italian night or picnic at home night.\",\n",

Reduce your bill by ensuring that your services are based on how you actually watch television rather than on what you think you'd like to watch (but then don't). You may want to: Determine what channels you actually watch and switch to the least expensive package your cable or satellite company offers that contains those channels. Consider a TV antenna, either a roof type or an indoor one that includes an amplifier. Most areas in the country can get ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and PBS and most of these networks will offer more than one channel. For example, PBS has 3 different channels. Pay TV only carries one. Shop around. You may be able to find the channels you want for a lower price with another provider. Make some phone calls or check other providers' websites for packages and pricing. Consider subscribing to a streaming and/or DVD delivery service. Services such as Netflix, Hulu Plus and Blockbuster allow you to stream movies and television shows right to your computer or television and/or receive DVD rentals by mail. If most of the movies and/or the television shows you watch are available, one of these services may be much less expensive than cable or satellite.

Getting rid of your data plan. If you have email and internet service on your phone, you may be paying anywhere from 10 to 50 extra dollars per month for your cell phone service. If you already have Internet and email service at home and/or at work, consider dropping the data plan and saving a chunk of change.

So instead of purchasing video games as soon as they come out, consider only purchasing older, less expensive games, buying your games used at a local video store or website such as eBay, or renting them from a local store or online mail service. Consider using app games instead––these are plentiful, cheaper, and allow for switching allegiances constantly without too much loss of money (and definitely no dust).',\n",

Whether it is college or professional sports, basketball, or football, the big game can almost certainly be viewed from home, a friend’s home, or a local bar or restaurant.

It is probably a good idea though to save your pennies for one special game of the season, so that you're not feeling completely deprived.\",\n",

       "  'Go easy on children’s entertainment expenses. There are many ways to entertain your kids for less. Keep in mind that your presence and engagement with your kids is the best gift they could ever have. Expensive toys can never make up for you always being too busy to play with them. Some ideas for cheap or free entertainment include: Take a trip to the park. Parks and playgrounds are an endless source of free entertainment for young children. Bring a picnic and make it an afternoon. Visit the library. Not only can you check out great books and videos, but the kids can also all play online at the same time, participate in story time and crafts, and get help with their homework. Libraries offer many programs and activities for children to learn and play. Check with your local library for information on programs it offers. Bake together. Children, young and old, love to bake and decorate cookies, cakes, and pies. So spend the afternoon or evening in the kitchen snacking! Make a craft project. Children love to draw, color, paint, cut, and glue. Look online for children’s craft ideas and spend a low cost afternoon making crafts. Play a board or card game. Children of all ages enjoy board and card games, and many modern games are made so that both children and adults can have fun playing them. Or get out the tablet and play a game on it together.',\n",
       "  \"Think local. You can find quite a bit of low cost entertainment locally, if you know where to look. Check local websites for Information on children's activities in your area. Some things to consider in the way of local entertainment: Local musicians, comedians, and performers can be seen in parks, concert halls, outdoor theaters, community centers, and bars on almost any night of the week, and they cost less than half of what a concert or Broadway show does. County fairs and city carnivals offer inexpensive, close-to-home entertainment throughout the summer. City and community activities such as ice cream socials, free concerts or shows in the park, and covered bridge festivals are offered by many small and large towns. Check your city’s website, or check with City Hall for information on activities offered by your community. High school college games and events. Many high schools offer admission to games, band concerts, talent shows, and dance performances at little to no cost. Colleges and universities also offer plays, music concerts, and ball game tickets at inexpensive prices.\",\n",

If none are in your area, listen to national radio broadcasts for advertisements of casinos in other areas. Note the location that is mentioned in each advertisement that involves a casino. If no locations are mentioned, note any additional contact information, such as a website or phone number. Use that information to find out where the casinos are.',\n",

For example, Richard Melville Hall was nicknamed Moby by his parents, and he uses this as his stage name.',\n",
       "  'Use your middle name. Go with a singular name that is just your middle name, such as the rapper Drake, whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham.Similarly, Angelina Jolie Voight dropped her last name, moving her middle name to the surname position.',\n",
       "  'Use your family tree as inspiration. Use your great-grandmother’s first name or your great-uncle’s middle name. This can help you retain a connection to your family with your stage name.',\n",

Liberace, for example, dropped his first name, Wladziu, and just went by one name. Some performers may have started their careers with their full names – or with a stage first and last name. Reinventing your career may involve reinventing your name, but you might still want to hang onto some of the reputation or recognition that you already have. Drop your last name from your stage name and go with just a single name. Alternately, add your last name. If you’ve been using a single name, consider adding a last name to reinvent yourself. You might also change or alter your last name. Some performers add last names (with or without a hyphen), such as Courtney Cox adding Arquette to her last name when she got married (she dropped Arquette when the marriage ended).',\n",
       "  'Choose the same last name as your parent’s stage last name. If you have performers in your family, you may want to link your stage name with their stage names. These can help you gain a reputation and recognition among fans and employers. For example, Carlos Irwin Estévez became Charlie Sheen in order to match his last name to his actor father Martin Sheen, whose real name is Ramón Antonio Gerardo Estévez. Another son, Emilio, kept the family last name.'],\n",
       " 'How to Keep Hobby Costs Down': [\"Pursue less costly hobbies. It's a fair bet that writing will cost less than motorcycle racing. Money isn't the only reason to choose or avoid a hobby, but you should certainly consider the costs. Choose hobbies that require time, creativity, skill, ingenuity, or knowledge rather than money or gear. Light aircraft flying, designer shopping, car modding and playing the latest video games are all likely to be expensive hobbies. Perhaps saving up for them in the future is a better approach than trying to participate in them now without the money needed to make them enjoyable.\",\n",
       "  \"Keep ancillary costs down. Gardening isn't a cheap hobby if you decide you need a riding mower and a pickup truck to get it done, or if you change plants as often as you change clothes. Instead, enjoy the challenge and the rewards of growing from seed, transplants, and cuttings. Get smaller plants cheaply and grow them into larger ones. Learn to save seeds if you like to grow vegetables or other annuals. On the other hand, if you have a large area to mow, a riding mower might be worth the investment, especially if it frees up your time to enjoy the gardening as a whole. Could you share both the mower and the cost with neighbors?\",\n",
       "  \"Stay close to home. If you have to drive for hours to see snow, don't ski. Find something else to do outdoors, such as skating or bicycling.\",\n",
       "  \"Learn the hobby well before you buy or upgrade too much gear. You can learn a lot about photography with a $20 secondhand camera and some practice. You can do a lot of astronomy with your own eyes or with the pair of binoculars you already own. Learning the hobby first is also a good way to avoid having stacks of leftover stuff if you tend to switch around frequently. Borrow or rent to try out hobbies that require large investments in gear such as mountain climbing or hang-gliding, before you start buying. If you find you dislike them or simply don't have time to pursue them, you won't be left with a lot of depreciating equipment. Learn to be resourceful rather than spend money. Look for used equipment and materials opportunities. Many hobbyists sell their good condition equipment through clubs, in the newspaper, and online.\",\n",
       "  'Stick to hobbies and projects that you like. If you enjoy doing something, do more of it using what you already have rather than starting new hobbies or projects frequently. Sometimes you can use common equipment and build common skills for a single basic activity while enjoying it in very different contexts. For instance, if you\\'re now a classical violinist, you might enjoy \"fiddling\" for folk music, too.If you\\'re now a wedding, portrait, documentary, or wildlife photographer, you might enjoy sports photography (don\\'t buy a monster lens, just increase the ISO a bit) and, while you\\'re at it, learn how to deal with the jumpiest subjects possible. This doesn\\'t mean you shouldn\\'t try new things. It does mean that you should stay the course, complete projects, and master the hobbies you have already chosen to pursue before chasing new ones.',\n",
       "  'Consider new purchases carefully. For equipment, choose durable items that will last a long time and give you plenty of use. Assuming you will pursue a hobby for a long time to come, plan for your supplies to last a long time.',\n",
       "  'Maintain your equipment. Once you have good, durable equipment, do what is necessary to keep it in good working order. Often, minor maintenance along the way can prevent major maintenance later on. Whether it means rinsing your swimsuit or oiling your sewing machine, take the time to keep your gear in good shape.',\n",
       "  'Buy only the supplies you know you will use. You can\\'t knit without yarn or quilt without fabric, but that doesn\\'t mean you need to stockpile or hoard yarn. Try to have a project in mind before purchasing supplies. For some creative pastimes, it is worth keeping some supplies around so that they\\'re available when inspiration strikes. If this is the way you pursue your hobby, gradually build up a reasonable selection of supplies as your budget permits. Then, try to acquire supplies at about the same rate you use them. Keeping your \"stash\" at a reasonable level will also help make it easy to organize. Try to use up your supplies or \"outgrow\" your gear before buying more. Keep in mind supplies that go out of stock or change with time. For example, paint or fabric patterns might change if you don\\'t get enough at the beginning of your project. In this case, stockpiling is a safeguard of quality rather than hoarding. Learn to make the most of simple materials. Some people do incredible, photorealistic drawings with a basic, ballpoint pen. Woodworkers sometimes hold 2x4 contests, where the objective is to make something wonderful from a single building-grade 2x4 board.',\n",
       "  'Get a better price. Buy used if it makes sense to do so. Many people stop pursuing hobbies after a time and sell or discard perfectly good, used equipment and supplies. Watch for sales and bargains on the items you buy new. One dollar worth of thrift store thread made a scarf, a toy hammock, and a couple of coasters. Look into getting used gear or supplies, especially your first time out, for costly items. Thrift store yarn or a skein of cheap acrylic will get you a long way to learning knitting or crochet much more cheaply than making your mistakes on fancy yarn. If you have $200 to spend on a bicycle, see if you can get a better used bike for that price than a new one. If your hobby is seasonal, look for opportunities to get things at the end of their seasons when they are marked down for clearance. Use found materials, discarded materials, scraps, or remnants. Besides being free or low-cost, scraps can constrain and focus your creativity in unexpected, serendipitous ways.',\n",
       "  'Choose hobbies that will save you money, or at least improve your lifestyle at moderate expense. Get into do-it-yourself home improvement. Learn woodworking or canning. Grow your own food, or some of it. Riding a bike could save you a lot of money on fuel and wear and tear on your car, not to mention the cost of a gym membership. Choose complementary hobbies. If you love to ride bikes, try learning how to fix them, too. If you already love to cook, canning or other food preservation methods may be a natural next step. One hobby could save you money on the other and extend your skills without needing a lot of new stuff.',\n",

Use this money for supplies, equipment, travel, and any other hobby related expenses, and don't go over it.\",\n",
       "  'Keep travel and event costs in check. Not all hobbies require travel, but if yours involves travel or going to events, include these costs in your budget, and keep the number and costs of the events you attend reasonable. You can decide what reasonable is for you. Figure for travel costs, admission, entry fees, hotels, and any other costs associated with attendance. Attend only local events and meets, or attend the local meets/shows and one or two big regional ones annually. Or consider attending on alternate years.',\n",

The level where your sales cover your materials and treats comes quite early, the level you can use it as a second job or live on it takes more skill and more work. Self supporting hobbies often allow you to use the best and most expensive materials and tools as those pay for themselves with better sales and better pricing. Sell your creations. If you make something in the course of your hobby, get good at it and try selling it. Be sure to price it appropriately. Sell your services. If you've learned how to repair bicycles or cars, tend a garden, paint portraits, or take photographs, see if you can start a business doing that or work for someone else who does. Teach your hobby. Offer lessons in doing whatever you've gotten good at. Write about your hobby. Especially if you have gotten into something unusual, write about your hobby and sell your book or the advertisements on your website. Invent equipment or equipment modifications related to your hobby and sell those. A pattern for baby shoes. Invent projects and sell plans or patterns to other hobbyists.\"],\n",

If you have a very large group, find creative ways to make sure the size doesn't become overwhelming.

If your participants have homework to do before the workshop takes place, be sure that your expectations are clearly stated from the beginning. Be sure to set hard deadlines if your students have to submit work to the group ahead of time. Be clear about where and how your students should submit their work. Will they have to give you hard copies, or will you circulate materials by email?\",\n",

       " 'How to Create Printed Circuit Boards': [\"Choose a method to use for creating the PCB. Your choice will usually be based on the availability of materials needed by the method, the technical difficulty level of the method or the quality of PCB you desire to obtain. Here's a brief summary of the different methods and their main features that will help you decide: Acid etching method: this method requires extreme safety measure, the availability of many materials such as the etchant and it is somewhat slow. The quality of PCB obtained varies according to the materials you use but generally, it is a good method for simple to intermediate levels of complexity circuits. Circuits involving more close wiring and tiny wires usually use other methods. UV etching method: this method is used for transposition of your PCB layout onto your PCB board and requires more expensive materials that might not be available everywhere. However, the steps are relatively simple and can produce finer and more complicated circuit layouts. Mechanical etching/routing method: this method requires special machines that will mechanically etch away unnecessary copper from the board or route empty separators between wires. It can be expensive if you intend to buy one of those machines and usually leasing them requires the availability of a workshop nearby. However, this method is good if you need to create many copies of the circuit and also can produce fine PCBs. Laser etching method: this is usually used by large production companies, but can be found on some universities. The concept is similar to mechanical etching but LASER beams are used to etch the board. It is usually hard to access such machines, but if your local university is one of the lucky ones having such machine, you can use their facilities if they allow it.\",\n",
       "  \"Create the PCB Layout of your circuit. For acid etching, you need to draw the circuitry using an etchant resistant material. Special markers can be found easily for this specific purpose if you intend to do the drawing by hand (not appropriate for medium to large circuits). Laser printers' ink is the most commonly used material however. This is usually done by converting your circuit's schematic diagram into a PCB layout using PCB layout software. There are many open source software packages for PCB layout creation and design, some are listed here to give you a head-start: PCB Liquid PCB ShortCut\",\n",
       "  \"Print out the diagram from the software's File menu. Print it out on a glossy paper, such as magazine paper.

       " 'How to Cope with a Bedridden Parent': [\"Help with basic hygiene. A bedridden person may or may not be able to keep with their own hygiene tasks. If they can't, you or another caregiver will need to help them. Even if they can, you might need to provide them with reminders and the tools to take care of their hygiene. Bathing, dental care, nail care, hair care, and changing clothes are all tasks your parent may need help with. For bathing, you may be able to help your parent into a shower chair (using a wheelchair), where they can mostly bathe themselves with some supervision. On the other hand, they may need a sponge bath. If your parent is completely bedridden, you'll need to bring items to them. For instance, you can bring a toothbrush, a cup with clean water, and a spitting cup over to the bed. Let the person brush their teeth or ask them to open their mouth so you can brush their teeth. Make sure you are helping them trim their nails regularly. They will likely need help with their toenails, even if they don't need help with their fingernails. You'll also need to help the person shave. An electric razor works best for this process, particularly if you've never shaved anyone else.\",\n",
       "  \"Watch for bed sores. Being bedridden comes with certain health risks that you need to help watch out for if you're providing care for your parent. For instance, bed sores are a common problem. They generally appear where the person's body touches the mattress, such as the bottom of the feet, the shoulders, the buttocks, and the back of the head.To combat pressure sores, try to change your parent's position every 2 hours, and encourage them to move their body in the bed as much as possible. You can also find special mattresses and cushions that can help relieve pressure points. Pay attention to the sheets. They should be cotton or silk, and you should smooth them out before putting your parent on them, as wrinkled sheets can increase the chance of bed sores. Make sure your parent's skin is moisturized regularly. Also, avoid using scented soaps and talcum powder, as those can dry out the skin. Dry skin makes your parent more susceptible to bed sores. It can also help to make sure your parent is drinking at least 2 liters of fluid a day. On people with darker skin, you may see blue or purple patches, while the patches will be red or white on lighter-skinned people. Cracks, wrinkles, swelling, shiny areas, blisters, and dry areas are also indicators of bed sores. Talk to a nurse if you start noticing these signs.\",\n",
       "  'Look for signs of chest problems. When laying in bed regularly, liquids can build up in the lungs, leading to congestion and even pneumonia. The best way to combat this problem is to make sure your parent is rotated to a new position regularly, preferably every 2 hours.',\n",
       "  \"Provide emotional support. The emotional side of a illness can be just as destructive as the physical side. When your parent becomes bedridden, they can't do the things they used to or visit with the people they enjoyed seeing regularly.Encourage people to come over and visit with your parent, so they have regular interaction. Also, try to encourage your parent to still participate in activities they enjoy as much as possible. For instance, if your parent enjoys making art, get them a small set of art supplies they can use in bed with a table. It's also important to provide a safe place where your parent can talk about what's going on. They need a sounding board as much as you do. You can be this person some of the time, but make sure that your parent feels comfortable talking with other people as well. If you are their only source of support, then this can put a lot of pressure on you when you already have so much going on.\",\n",
       "  'Ask about a social worker. Often, a person who is bedridden will qualify for having a social worker assist with their needs. A social worker can benefit you, too, as they can help you find the care you need for your parent, as well as other resources.Most hospitals have social services on site, though you can also visit a Medicare/Medicaid office in your local community, or visit the offices of an insurance company that that your parent goes through.',\n",
       "  'Request help from friends and family. When your parent is sick, you may feel like you\\'re alone in the situation. However, more often than not, friends and family would like to help you, but they don\\'t know how. Take the time to meet with friends and family members one at time to ask for help.It is important to be assertive when asking for help from friends and family. Try saying, \"I\\'m creating a weekly schedule for Mom\\'s care. Please let me know which two days you would like this week.\" Offer a specific task if they don\\'t seem to know how to help. If you have children, then you might also consider asking a friend or family member to watch them for you one evening per week while you care for your parent. Be sure to let your children know why you need someone to watch them during these times.',\n",
       "  \"Let the professionals help. If your parent has become bedridden, it's likely you'll need some help from professional caregivers. If you're caring for the person at home, you can get help from people who come to the house. If the person will need long-term care, you may need to consider placing them in a facility that can provide care. If your parent has a terminal illness, hospice care may provide some relief.Both in-home care and care facilities can be expensive. Insurance and medicare may cover some in-home care (which sometimes includes in-home care at senior facilities). Have a talk with your parent about getting some help. They may not like the idea much, as some people are reluctant to have outside help. If you need help persuading them, try asking someone who's been in a similar situation to help. It might also be hard for your parent to hear this from you. You might consider asking someone who has a different relationship with your parent to talk with them instead, such as a close friend, a cousin, or a spiritual leader. You can hire whatever level of care you need. For instance, some non-medical care can help with basics like bathroom assistance and meals. However, if your parent needs medical care, you will need to hire nurses or nursing aids to help, though that kind of care is generally prescribed by a doctor.\",\n",
       "  \"Acknowledge your emotions. When your parent is bedridden, you likely will have a surplus of emotions, which is perfectly normal. You may find you feel anger or resentment. You might feel guilty that you can't spend more time with them or that they're bedridden and you're not. You also may feel anxiety about the situation. Grief is also common, as you've lost who your parent was.Let yourself feel those emotions. Acknowledge them, and give yourself permission to feel them. Also, make sure you find someone to talk to. Anyone with a sympathetic ear will do.Writing down your feelings is also a good way to get them out and understand them better. Try keeping a journal as well. You can also talk with others who are facing the same issue. You can join a local support group or find one online. In fact, if your parent is on hospice, many hospice organizations have grief support groups available for people in your situation. Just knowing you're not alone can help. Professional counseling can also be beneficial. If your parent is bedridden, particularly if they have a terminal illness, it can be difficult to come to terms with that, especially if you have a complicated relationship with your parent. A professional can help you work through those feelings and come to terms with what's happening.\",\n",
       "  \"Ask questions. When it comes to a parent's failing health, you may find that having specific answers can somehow make the diagnosis more manageable. When you have questions about your parent's health, ask the doctors and nurses. If you don't understand their answer, ask them to explain it in layperson's terms. You deserve to know what's going on (with your parent's consent, of course).Taking notes or having another person there to help you remember everything during conversations with doctors and nurses can also be helpful. Emotions may be high, which might make it hard for you to remember everything.\",\n",
       "  'Take care of your spiritual needs. Take time to do things you normally do for your spiritual self, such as praying or meditating. These activities can have a calming effect in a stressful situation. Of course, not everyone considers themselves a spiritual person, and that may be the case with you. Nonetheless, it can still help to take a few minutes each day to just be or sit in silence.',\n",
       "  \"Enjoy what you can. When you're taking care of a parent, it can be difficult to find time for yourself to do things you enjoy. However, it's very important to take time each day to relax if you can. It can be something seemingly insignificant, like drawing a little picture or watching the birds outside. Whatever it is, take some time each day to do something you enjoy.Similarly, it's important to maintain the relationships in your life. Try to get away to spend time with people you care about, so you can just be you for a while.At the very least, set aside some time each day to return calls, respond to text messages, or check in with your other loved ones. Also, take time to escape. That is, sometimes, escaping into the fantasy world of a book, movie, or television show can give you the mental break you need. You can even enjoy these with your parent. Listening to your favorite music can also help you take a break.Be sure to schedule this time in. Don’t wait until you feel like you need a break.\",\n",
       "  \"Determine your limitations. When you're providing care, you need to make sure you know what your limits are. Determine how much time you can actually give, as well as how much physical care you can give. Be firm with those limits, and get help as needed.For example, it is important to maintain your relationship with your spouse/partner and children (if you have them). This might mean that certain times of the day will be set aside for spending time with your family, such as dinner time.\",\n",
       "  \"Maintain your health. When you're caring for someone, it can be easy to neglect your physical health, but it's important to make that a priority, too. Make sure you're eating enough and that you're eating healthy meals with lean protein, whole grains, fruits, and veggies. Try to get some exercise in when you can, as it will lower your stress level and keep you healthy.In addition, make getting enough sleep a priority. Even if you can get enough sleep all at at once, try to work in 7 to 9 hours a day to make sure you'll be able to function.

Being vegetarian is a good way to reduce your calorie intake and get loads of vitamins and minerals, but that being said, it can be done wrong. While it's not the best idea to go fully vegetarian, most people do eat far too much meat. A good idea is to change the amount and types of meat you eat: swap pork chops for lean chicken; steak for tuna. A high-fiber diet is easily had without meat. Fiber has been shown to lower your cholesterol, control your blood-sugar levels, improve your bowel health, and make you less likely to overeat. The recommended fiber intake is 30g a day for men and 21g for women; after the age of 50, this jumps up to 38g for men and 25g for women.

Food that stays on the shelves often has added sodium, words that end in -ose, and trans and saturated fats in the ingredient list. If you see these on the label (especially if they're in high amounts), avoid them. You can find a healthier alternative elsewhere. It's not worth it. Just because it says it has no trans fat doesn't actually mean it has no trans fat.

If you are living in ongoing sin, or you’ve committed sins recently, you are separated from God. You must confess those things and turn away from them. This will mend the broken connection with God.The reason this is important is that sin means going against what God wants from you. When you sin, you separate yourself from God. To confess and repent simply means to tell God that you know you have sinned, that you are sorry, and that you want to change. Pray to God, “I’m sorry I was so rude to my neighbor.

Although you may know exactly what you want, God may have much more for you than you could think to ask for. If you only ask for the thing you want, you could miss out on a larger blessing.

This will require you to think primarily about times in your life when things seemed to have quality or value and then look rationally at the opposite times when they didn't. Select one of these to test, preferable one that had a lot of value to you, because these are easier to handle without creating unpleasant feelings. Look carefully at the memory, firstly to see if it is still fresh and accurate and not too dulled over a long time. Here it is best to compare the two - what underwrites the ones we feel are lacking or not quality moments were the ones where there was an aspect of dissatisfaction present in the moment, or afterwards on evaluation. It is important to explore this dissatisfaction because this is the central aspect of every time we feel unhappy.\",\n",
       "  'Further explore the varieties of this dissatisfaction. Consider that there might be the case where the event seemed exciting at first, but over long term handling or experience it seems dull, like a \"commodity\". For example, you might find at first going out for a meal to be exciting and fun, but if you have to buy your meal everyday, it soon seems ordinary and loses interest. Where a meal cooked by yourself or by someone you care for is a different experience. Consider how much money was involved in the experience as this can affect the quality or value. There is a case where a person may hold the view have said that if you don\\'t charge for services, no one will appreciate its value. What really happens however is that the cost paid for it dulls the experience, because the money itself has to be earned so it has its own relative cost to us as individuals. It returns to being a commodity as you are paying for it, therefore you have an expectation of your money (or ultimately, your efforts) getting what they are worth, or a return of investment. Both parts actually make quite special things seem very ordinary and unimportant and the experience of quality and sense of value is lost. It is important to consider however this exercise really is not about expecting people to do things for nothing, for the flipside is that when you value something, you are often more likely to bid higher for it to attain that goal. Additionally, many needed services just won\\'t exist without money to cover their costs, so the balance is between money making operations, or exploitative and the differences between them. Part of the problem and indeed the solution is this same relative cost and return process. When we feel it wasn\\'t worth the cost, or that we paid more than it was worth we are dissatisfied.',\n",
       "  'Consider times that you have found satisfaction in doing something by yourself. A simple case is working in the home or garden. When you decorate your space yourself, it feels so much more genuine than if you paid someone to do it for you. This is because of your personal involvement and efforts to achieve a goal, goal setting and achievement being a big booster to our personal confidence, management skills and personal satisfaction. Consider likewise if your selected experience you were unsatisfied with had a mental or emotional \"cost\". It may have been you were manipulated, pressured, begged or flattered into doing something that if you had a choice you would say no to, or offered a product that while may have been good quality, seems overpriced. Many methods exist in coercing a person to do something they don\\'t want. This has a terrible cost to both sides. The alternative is when you do something for someone else, or vice versa (without any obligation or expectation, but just out of friendship, kindness or compassion), or share moments with people in a beneficial context it seems so much more precious and these are the memories that people cherish. This is because there is no physical or mental \"cost\" paid, or that the cost had a return of satisfaction. This is well reflected in people who follow a virtue system, volunteer their time or live a little more frugally within their economic means. The sacrifice of personal time and efforts, or practicing self control against our easier desires gives in effect a return of the investment of effort. These practitioners typically feel more satisfaction and more frequent satisfaction and so develop a sense of life-quality, but also appreciate things and people wisely and are consequently appreciated and valued by others. This gives satisfaction which increases the sense of value and quality.',\n",
       "  'Consider the alternative cases where you are prepared to pay whatever the cost is. This will help you explore the limitations, or ways to more wisely practice activities that will increase value and not compromise it. When we are driven to extremes about what may seem virtuous or good actions will compromise and happiness. This is because we no longer have any control - our feelings effectively turned rogue and we lose that self direction. There is a host of areas where this applies, it may be a social or community aspects, religious or spiritual, environmental, economical, identity, political and nationality issues you may be very passionate about. Its all about reflecting that while these may be good things within themselves, is it possible that a person may have such strong desires to get involved even if it goes too far and breaks the law. There are cases more mundane such as you want to buy a particular type of car, so you over-extend your finances to be able to get it, even when you only use it for something a more economical car would be appropriate. When it has reached the extremes, primarily self importance has over-ruled which drives people to do these actions, which can be reflected in how easy it is for a person to step back and let go. There are cases where a person just wants to be personally involved for it has become \"personal\", or through peer-pressure is encouraged into doing it. This also has a terrible cost, because it develops into the feeling that nothing becomes important anymore (in order to achieve that goal). Cases also exist similar to addictions where because of the feeling of power we gain, these cases may constantly seek a way to be involved and express their feelings. The return of investment can also be corrupted - A person may also go into the habit that they will only do something for someone else, but only if they get something in return. Quality is diminished very easily and its largely when it is tainted by greed or obligation, which reduces the true satisfaction that builds wisdom and happiness.',\n",

Whatever occurs you from your experiences. Now imagine that same event, but change it slightly, such as if you were obliged to do those things that you didn\\'t want to, or that you were doing it to get something, or that you were possessed by the urge to \"buy it\" when you really didn\\'t need it. What has changed? Did the feeling stay the same, or did it become slightly tainted and quality or value is lost? This merely is a practical reflection or test you can do to test the above sections for yourself. The goal now is to learn when you are being manipulated or greedy and so be able make a stand to say \"thanks, but no thanks\". This isn\\'t easy, but you have to ask yourself if the small unpleasant feeling of saying no, is more or less than the price paid for saying yes. This is hard because many cases exist where a person is manipulated by their close friends and family, but are afraid they will end up alone as they don\\'t have anyone else. On one hand its certain that this is a low quality life, essentially being used as a doormat, on the other it is not unreasonable for the person to want to tolerate it for the sake of keeping the relationships. This simply is the cost that must be paid for the association as it is.',\n",

As the mind is inclined to extreme sides dancing from one to the other, there is a lot of various ways this may manifest but some common options to consider are: It is possible a person may suddenly feel horrified at all the misery, misfortunes, manipulation and exploitation in this life and want to get as far away as possible from it, whether they run away from people, or take their own life. As it is a central part of ordinary human interaction, it can't be avoided without becoming an recluse and that can make us cold and lonely when we shun others. Diving in and sacrificing everything for others may make us vulnerable for the times when things don't go to plan. We can easily be hurt far more by being too generous. Dedicating your life trying to change people. As it is an effective method (after all, only until a person realizes they are being exploited will they know), so any extreme response leads into horror or misery, so less quality of life - people are resistant to change from outside, few will understand and even those that do are unlikely to implement difficult change. The only way to handle it is make a choice to let go and do what you feel is right. Taking one or several aspects too seriously or personally. This is what leads us to harm. Things that when wisely considered are rich in value become meaningless or even obstacles to achieve our desires.\",\n",
       "  \"Try to find ways to improve the quality of your life and make it fun, without their being a harm factor. Once you feel comfortable in saying no or yes according to the event, see what you can do to make life more interesting and better quality. This might be to learn something new, change bad habits, do something for yourself or other people without obligation, while keeping a balance so you aren't becoming another doormat. Then you are a free agent, because you have the choice to be. It is important to accept that life is not easy, nor that it owes us a living. We do not have complete will power to achieve everything, our willpower is naturally limited. By accepting our limitations and accepting that dis-satisfaction is therefore inevitable or unavoidable in life, we no longer will be that effected or hurt when it does happen. This two way system on letting go of the dissatisfaction, as well as implementing ways to improve what we experience is dependent on understanding how the dis-satisfaction arises in the first place, once that ignorance has been penetrated then it no longer is a demon in the closest or monster under the bed, because it has been understood for what it is.\"],\n",

       "  \"Make a list of possible songs with their original key. Once you have all the information about the types of songs you want to use, you are going to want to put all options into a list with their keys next to them. If you don't know the keys, look them up online and you should be able to find the key information, and if not, just guess what you think it might be in. Of course, if God told you any specific songs you will want to have those in their as well, even if they don't match the style of the church or the message.\",\n",

If you have too few songs, the set will sound awkward; you may have to fill time by playing again, one of the songs you already played! This is to be avoided at all costs. Find out how many songs you have time for, when you will be playing them, and whether or not they are split up. For example, the venue could tell you that you will be playing eight songs, so you set up those eight songs, but when you get there you find out you are playing four songs before the message and four songs after, which screws up the transitions you made for the 4th and 5th song.',\n",

Example a song in B flat and a song in C are close enough together to be considered similar as you can change the key of one or even both of the songs without making any drastic changes. These songs will go together quite well, especially if they are in the same time signature. One thing that really makes worship awkward is when the worship team finishes a song, it becomes completely quiet, and the crowd starts hearing the movement of capos on guitars. you are going to want to make easy transitions, and this means either having the songs in the same key, or similar keys.

If it\\'s not possible, don\\'t fret, it\\'s not that big of a deal. Once you are completely done with the arrangement of songs, move on to the next step. There are multiple ways to set up a set depending on how many songs you are playing and when you are playing them. You will want to play upbeat songs early, normal songs in the middle, and intimate songs towards the end. If you are playing a lot of songs, six or more, before the message, you will want to start off with upbeat songs that get people on their feet, like \"Sing Sing Sing\" by Chris Tomlin or \"Your Love Never Fails\" by Jesus Culture. Around halfway, get into a normal tempo like \"Better is One Day\", then towards the end drop down to intimate like \"This is The Air I Breathe\", or \"Prepare the Way\". If you are playing fewer songs before the message (four or five) you will want to keep the same structure, but keep it more on the upbeat side throughout. Don\\'t go all the way intimate. If you are playing just a couple songs before the message, (one to three) you will want to keep the same style throughout, preferably upbeat or normal. If you are playing many songs after the message, you will want to start off with an intimate feeling, then halfway through get all the way up to upbeat, then back down to normal or even intimate. If you are playing a few songs after the message, you will want to do the same structure as a lot of songs, but on the intimate side, meaning don\\'t have the upbeat songs. If you are playing just a couple of songs after the message, keep them the same tempo, preferably normal or intimate.',\n",
       "  \"Arrange a split set. Now, this whole thing changes a lot when your set is split up like the example above. If you are playing a lot of songs both before and after, play upbeat songs up front, then slow down to more normal songs towards the middle, then speed up right before the message to upbeat. After the message, start off with some really slow intimate songs, speed up to normal, and end with intimate. This is at variance with the prior step. The reason you want to do this is because, if you are playing more than six songs before and after the message, you risk tiring out your crowd's attention span. So you need to mix it up. If you go to see a band play live, notice that they throw in some random really upbeat or really intimate songs so you keep listening, and you want this same thing in worship, because, otherwise, they will stop worshipping. If you are playing a few songs before, start with upbeat and end with normal. The rest of the information is the same as above.\",\n",
       "  \"Figure out transitions. You want to keep the music flowing from one song to the next, and not have any sudden stops. When the next song is in the same key, keep playing the chord progression on an acoustic guitar very lightly and then change the progression according to the next song and continue. If two adjoining songs aren't in the same key, you can possibly make it sound like they are in the same key, for instance if you are playing a song in C and are changing to a song in G, you can keep playing C and G over and over again as they are in both C key and G key, then change to the G progression and it won't be at all noticeable unless your a musician. Even if there is just one note that's the same within the two keys, you might be able to have your guitarist keep playing that note and then continue in the next key once someone starts playing the new chord progression. Another way is to have the drummer keep playing and then have the rest of the band join in after changing keys. This can sound great if done right. If none of those are possibilities, have someone on your team pray or give a brief message while someone else starts playing the new chords. The audience will pay attention to the voice and not the music.\",\n",

If you don’t currently have a group to pray with, try to find one. You can find a group in a local worship center or church you attend. You can do a search online for people who share your beliefs to see if there are meetups happening in your area. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, consider starting your own prayer group.

Instead of class warfare Fascism believes in class collaboration - the different classes must all work together to help strengthen their community and their State.

       " 'How to Avoid Temptation to Sin': ['Identify your temptations and the personal flaws that create them. Everyone has their own temptations. Though Jesus never sinned, even he was tempted to. (Hebrews 4:15) Spend a few moments self-reflecting to identify your personal temptations. Then, pin down the personality traits that lead you to temptation - maybe you\\'re insecure or you\\'re never satisfied with yourself. Perhaps you prioritize pleasure over responsibility. No two people are exactly alike. Your temptations might resemble those of your friends, family, or other associates, but there\\'s also a chance that they\\'re unique to you. A priest, counselor, or other trusted person can help you discover your unique temptations and the flaws from which these temptations developed. If you\\'re having a hard time defining exactly what your temptations are, begin by pinpointing the things in your life that make you sad, then try to find a thought process or habit you possess that leads to these things. For instance, let\\'s say you\\'re in a committed relationship with a woman you love but you frequently feel intense guilt because you flirt with other women. Search your heart. Ask yourself, \"what do I think or do that makes me want to act like this?\" After some reflection, you may find, for instance, that you\\'re worried about whether you\\'re still attractive. The source of your temptation in this case is your sense of insecurity.',\n",
       "  'Set reasonable goals for fighting temptation. Your aim when fighting temptation should take into account the fact that, as a human being, you\\'re incapable of perfection. Don\\'t set an un-achievable goal like \"I will never sin again.\" If you do, you\\'re setting yourself up for disappointment. Realize that you will inevitably sin again (and again and again). Set a realistic goal that takes this into account. ] For instance, if you\\'ve been neglecting your child\\'s vocal recitals in favor of nights spent at home watching TV, you might set a goal of never missing another vocal recital (except for emergencies) and of reducing your time spent watching TV every week by four hours. This goal is well within your grasp. For a few very serious sins, it is absolutely necessary to set a zero-tolerance goal - for instance, you should obviously never commit murder or marital infidelity. These sins can cause irreparable damage to others\\' lives.',\n",
       "  \"Take responsibility for yourself. You were blessed with free will for a reason. Don't waste your opportunity to act decisively against your personal temptation by giving into the separate temptation of inaction! Stand up and take action now. Make it your goal going forward to not give in to your temptation. The hardest part of overcoming your temptation can be getting started. Don't sabotage your journey before it's begun by telling yourself you can't do it. When Jesus died, he gave us authority over the forces of evil. (Mark 16:17) Never fear or run from the forces of evil in your own life. With hard work and sincere faith, nothing is beyond your grasp.\",\n",
       "  'Turn your back on past sins. The one thing you can\\'t change about yourself is your past. Don\\'t let yourself be overcome by regret for sins that happened in the past. The only right path is forward, towards righteousness. If your past is marked by sin, acknowledge your mistakes without excessive guilt. Build upon your past mistakes. Strive never to make your old mistakes again. Even if you relapse, you\\'ll have made progress away from your sinful past. If you haven\\'t already, sincerely ask God for forgiveness. God is infinite in his capacity to forgive. In his eyes, once you are forgiven, it\\'s as if you had never committed sin in the first place: \"And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.\" (Hebrews 10:17)',\n",
       "  \"Avoid situations and people that lead to sin. Certain people, places, and situations make sinning easy. Certain sins are impossible without the right equipment, setting, or people. Make sure that you stay far away from the things that lead you to sin. If you have a drug addiction, stay out of the parts of town where these things are sold. If you're frequently persuaded by certain friends to commit acts of vandalism, don't hang out with these friends. By distancing yourself from the people and things associated with your sin, you're eliminating opportunities for sin and giving yourself less chances to fail. Generally, it's a good idea to help other people work through their own sins. However, if you're struggling with the pull of your own temptations, sinful people can make it difficult to escape. Wait until you have your temptations under control before returning to help these people with their own sins. Eliminate the sources of temptation from your home. For instance, throw out a pornography collection. You may, in some cases, need to eliminate distractions from your own home. For instance, kick out a roommate who frequently convinces you to neglect your responsibilities.\",\n",
       "  \"Get help. You don't need to fight your temptations alone. There is no shame in asking for help from God or from another person. If you're having difficulty avoiding your temptations, don't hesitate to turn to a priest, clergyman, pastor, counselor, or trusted friend. Accepting help is a strong, sensible thing to do and part of these peoples' purpose is to help you when you're experiencing difficulty. Certain temptations (like, for instance, the temptation to look at pornography) aren't necessarily seen as sinful by mainstream society, although they are. If you're looking for help with such a temptation, it might make more sense to consult a priest, rabbi, imam, etc. than a secular helper.\",\n",

There\\'s truth to the old saying \"Idle hands are the devil\\'s playthings.\" If you keep yourself busy with good, virtuous work or an assortment of hobbies, you\\'ll have less time to yourself and thus less time where you might feel the temptation to sin out of boredom. Devote yourself to your job or your studies by taking extra hours or signing up to be a tutor, for instance. Spend time learning an instrument or a new language. If you have lots of free time, do anything you can to fill your time with activities that can help you grow closer to God, or that make you a healthier, richer, or better person. If you\\'re struggling to think of things that you can do to occupy your time, a good place to start is at a local homeless shelter, crisis center, or community outreach center. Talk to the management - there\\'s a good chance they can make use of your unique talents to help the unfortunate in your community.',\n",
       "  'Be persistent. Temptation, unfortunately, doesn\\'t just go away when you choose to resist it. Temptation persists. Sometimes the conscious decision to fight a temptation will even make the temptation temporarily stronger. If you decide to resist your temptation to gorge on chocolate, for instance, you may start getting cravings after a day or two without it. It takes time for temptations to fade - some never do. This doesn\\'t mean that you\\'re better off giving up! Fight your temptations tooth and nail. Don\\'t quit, even if you suffer setbacks or relapses. The more persistently you fight, the better chance you\\'ll have of beating your temptation. Never reward yourself with sinful \"allowances\" or \"breaks.\" Resist the slippery slope of instant gratification. This instant gratification can act deceitfully, causing you to feel that it\\'s not wrong, although it is in God\\'s eyes. Treat your temptations like bad habits that you must break. Work towards forming new good habits to replace your old ones by repeating good, virtuous behavior over and over again.',\n",
       "  \"Accept that temptation is inevitable. Know that, no matter how hard you strive, it's impossible to live a life without temptations. We will always, at certain points, feel a temptation to sin - whether it's as innocuous as the urge to lie about our reason for being late to a meeting or as serious as the urge to strike someone who's insulted you. It's also inevitable that we will give in to this urge at some point. However, it's possible, through our efforts, to reduce the hold that temptation has over us. The fight against temptation is like waging a lifelong war - be prepared to celebrate your victories and to learn from your defeats.\",\n",
       "  \"Don't be discouraged by your own imperfection. Never fall prey to self-hate. You are not loathsome or pathetic because you feel temptation. God always forgives.

Use your time more intelligently by sincerely asking for God's forgiveness and working to move past your sins.\",\n",
       "  'Study the word. Christian scripture is full of stories, teachings, and proverbs we can draw upon when we\\'re trying to avoid our sinful temptations. The nature of sin and temptation is a frequent topic of discussion throughout the bible - simply turn to a passage like Romans 7:18 for an illuminating perspective on the difficulty of struggling against temptation: \"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.\" Many of the most revered figures in the Bible had intense struggles with temptation(often marked with failure.)

Your doctor or pediatrician can tell you if your child has Down syndrome once they are born, but if you want to know beforehand, ask about the various types of screening tests. Prenatal screening tests can show if there is an increased likelihood your unborn baby has Down syndrome, but they are not a perfect estimate.If a prenatal screening test shows an increased likelihood your baby has Down syndrome, then your doctor will recommend a diagnostic test to be more certain. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that all women (regardless of age) get screening tests for Down syndrome. There are different screening tests related to how far along you are in your pregnancy and include: the first trimester combined test, the integrated screening test and the cell-free fetal DNA analysis.\",\n",
       "  \"Get the first trimester combined test. The first trimester combined test is done within the first 3 months of pregnancy and involves two steps: a blood test and an ultrasound exam.The blood test measures levels of PAPP-A (pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A) and HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) hormone being produced in your body. (HCG). In addition, a painless ultrasound exam is used on your abdomen to measure an area on the back of the fetus's neck called the nuchal translucency. Abnormal levels of PAPP-A and HCG typically indicate something unusual with your baby, but not necessarily Down syndrome. The nuchal translucency screening test measures the amount of fluid that's collected there. Abnormally high amounts of fluid usually indicates a genetic disability, but not just Down syndrome. Your doctor will consider your age (older equals higher risk), the results of the blood test, and the ultrasound images to decide if it's likely your fetus has Down syndrome. Just keep in mind that these types of tests are not done in every instance of pregnancy. However, if you are over 35, then you are at higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome and your doctor may recommend testing.\",\n",
       "  'Ask about the integrated screening test. The integrated screening test is done during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (within the first 6 months) and consists of 2 parts: a combined blood / ultrasound screening done in the first trimester looking at PAPP-A levels and nuchal translucency (as described above) and a more thorough blood test looking at pregnancy-related hormones and other substances.The second trimester blood test, called the \"quad screen\", measures levels of HCG, alpha fetoprotein, estriol and inhibin A in your body. Abnormal levels indicate a developmental or genetic problem in your baby. This test is essentially a follow-up to the first trimester combined test, as it adds a second trimester comparison blood test. If you\\'re carrying a baby with Down syndrome, you\\'ll have higher levels of HCG and inhibin A, but lower levels of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and estriol. The integrated screening test is as reliable as the first trimester combined test in estimating the likelihood of Down syndrome, but it has fewer false-positives — less women are told incorrectly they\\'re carrying a Down syndrome child.',\n",
       "  'Consider the cell-free fetal DNA analysis. The cell-free fetal DNA test checks for your baby\\'s (fetal) DNA material that\\'s circulating in your blood.A blood sample is taken and the genetic material is analyzed for abnormalities. This test is usually recommended if you\\'re at high risk for Down syndrome (older than 40 years) and/or have an abnormal result in another type of screening test. For this screening test, your blood can be analyzed during pregnancy after about 10 weeks. The cell-free fetal DNA analysis is much more specific than other screening tests for Down syndrome. A positive result means there\\'s a 98.6% chance that your baby has Down syndrome, whereas a \"negative\" result means there\\'s a 99.8% chance your baby doesn\\'t.If this DNA screening test is positive, then your doctor will recommend a more invasive diagnostic test to confirm Down syndrome (see below).',\n",

If your doctor recommends a diagnostic test, it means they think you're at high risk for Down syndrome based on the results of screening test(s) combined with your age. However, although a prenatal diagnostic test can determine the presence of Down syndrome with certainty, they carry a higher risk to your health and that of your baby's because they are more invasive.As such, consult with your doctor about the pros and cons of such testing. Invasive testing means that a needle or similar implement must be inserted into your abdomen and uterus to take a sample of fluid or tissue in order to analyze it. Diagnostic tests that can positively identify Down syndrome in pregnant women include: amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and cordocentesis. However, keep in mind that these procedures do not come without risks. There is a risk of bleeding, infection, and harm to the fetus.\",\n",
       "  \"Get an amniocentesis done. An amniocentesis involves collecting a sample of amniotic fluid that surrounds your growing baby. A long needle is inserted into your uterus (through your lower abdomen) in order to withdraw fluid that contains some cells from your baby.The chromosomes of the cells are then analyzed, looking for trisomy 21 or other genetic disabilities. An amniocentesis is usually performed during the second trimester, between weeks 14 to 22 of pregnancy.The main risk of amniocentesis is a miscarriage and death of the baby, which increases if it's done before 15 weeks. The risk of a spontaneous termination (miscarriage) from amniocentesis is estimated at 1%.Amniocentesis can also distinguish between the slightly different forms of Down syndrome: regular trisomy 21, translocation Down syndrome and mosaic Down syndrome.\",\n",
       "  'Consider chorionic villus sampling (CVS). In a CVS procedure, cells are taken from a part of the placenta (which surrounds your baby within your uterus) called the chorionic villus and used to analyze the chromosomes for an abnormal number.This test also requires inserting a large needle into your abdomen / uterus. CVS is usually performed in the first trimester, between 9 to 11 weeks of pregnancy, although after the 10th week is considered less risky. This test be done sooner than amniocentesis, which is important if you plan to abort the baby if it has Down syndrome. A CVS carries a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than a second trimester amniocentesis — perhaps slightly more than a 1% chance of miscarriage. A CVS can also distinguish between the slightly different genetic forms of Down syndrome.',\n",

With cordocentesis, also called percutaneous umbilical blood sampling or PUBS, fetal blood is taken from a vein in the umbilical cord through the uterus with a long needle and examined for genetic mutations (extra chromosomes).This diagnostic test is performed later in the second trimester, between 18 to 22 weeks of gestation. A cordocentesis is the most accurate diagnostic method for Down syndrome and can confirm the results from an amniocentesis or CVS procedure.PUBS carries a much greater risk of miscarriage than amniocentesis or CVS, so your doctor should only recommend it if results from other diagnostic tests are unclear.',\n",

A chromosomal karyotype requires a sample of your baby's blood to analyze for an extra 21st chromosome, which can be present in all or some cells.

Know the most common delivery methods for bioterrorism agents (listed below) so that, in the event of an attack, you will be better prepared to protect yourself. Food and water contamination: Certain bioterrorism agents can persist in food and water, especially if consumed unheated. Thoroughly cooking food and boiling water can help kill these pathogens. Animal transmission: Some animals, especially pests like mosquitoes and ticks, can be vectors for deadly diseases. Keeping pest-control agents (insecticides, etc.) is a smart choice to protect against this dispersal method. Person-to-person transmission: Diseases like smallpox spread extremely contagiously simply from person-to-person contact. In these cases, physically staying away from infected people (via quarantine, for instance) is the best move. Aerosol transmission: In perhaps the most dangerous method of transmission, a few bioterrorism agents (like anthrax) can be converted to a fine mist and spread through the air, where they can drift for miles and cause infection upon inhalation. In this case, closing windows and doors and using a proper gas mask can help prevent infection.',\n",

If any water does happen to flow a little higher from gushing, hand-motion inside, or even an earthquake, a narrow overflow tube handles any overflow problems. So, as long as the toilet is functioning properly, no water should spill outside of the porcelain tank. This type is the staple toilet, simple, effective, and durable.The flushing sound for gravity assisted toilets also isn't particularly loud and they are easy to repair. However, if you have a lot of people using your toilet (say, a large family) or are going to be putting a lot of wear on the toilet's flush system, gravity-assisted toilets may not have enough power to flush consistently, after every use.Think about purchasing a standard gravity-assisted toilet if you have a small family or a bathroom that will be getting minimal use.\",\n",
       "  'Consider a pressure-assisted toilet. Unlike gravity assisted, pressure-assisted toilets have an ‘active’ rather than a passive mechanism. This type adds pressure to the force of gravity by supplying more force than the traditional unit. Water displaces air inside a sealed cylindrical tank, usually made of metal or plastic, inside the larger ceramic tank, helping to generate a larger force.However, because the water in the tank is held under pressure, it flushes with greater force, resulting in a loud flushing sound. As well, a greater amount of pressure via your toilet can put stress on older pipes and plumbing in your home, which can lead to a leak or a busted pipe.Go for a pressure-assisted toilet if you live in a newer building or a home with new, well kept pipes, and low water pressure.',\n",
       "  \"Consider a vacuum-assisted toilet. This type innovates on the standard gravity-assisted toilet by using a vacuum that draws the water with more force into the bowl using the rim holes in the upper toilet bowl. Vacuum-assisted toilets have a cleaner, quieter flush than other models, making them ideal for a bathroom near your bedroom, or by a quiet area of your home. However, unclogging this type of toilet requires some time and skill. To unplug the bowl, you have to take the lid off and put your hand over an opening in the tank for the plunging action to work. The vacuum-assisted toilet also costs about $100 more than a gravity toilet. Think about getting this type if you're looking for a toilet with quiet but powerful flushing, and are willing to spend some extra money up front.\",\n",
       "  'Consider a power-assisted toilet. This type uses an even greater force than vacuum-assisted toilets. In fact, power-assisted toilets are known as the only \"toilets with horsepower\".These toilets have a 0.2 horsepower motor in the tank to literally blast waste products down the drain, making them ideal if your bathroom has old pipes. Power-assisted toilets can also save the average family 2,000 gallons of water per year. However, these toilets have a pump that must be plugged into a power outlet, they are known for their incredibly loud flushing sound and they are currently the most expensive type of toilet on the market.Think about purchasing a power-assisted toilet if you\\'re in need of a model with a super powerful flush, regardless of upkeep or cost.',\n",
       "  \"Consider a dual flush toilet. These toilets have two buttons on the tank, one for a half tank flush, the other for a full tank flush (obviously, you utilize either flush based on your needs). Originally invented in Australia to respond to the country's constant drought cycle, dual flush toilets are just starting to gain popularity in North America, and have the best water conservation system of any other models. In fact, studies have shown that a dual-flush toilet uses an average of just 6.9 gallons per day, compared to 9.5 gallons of a low-flow toilet and 19 gallons with the older models. This type can save a household 2,250 gallons of water per a year, and because there are two flushing options, you have the choice between a lighter sounding flush and a louder sounding flush.However, this type has a high up front price tag, and high installation costs. Go for a dual flush toilet if you're looking for an eco friendly, option friendly toilet. Keep in mind that the long term benefits of a dual flush toilet in terms of water savings may be worth the initial cost.\",\n",
       "  \"Determine the toilet's flushing power. Finding a toilet that flushes effectively without clogging is essential. But, a toilet with less water usage does not always mean it has less flushing power than another model.The ideal toilet would have great waste removal and high clog resistance. To learn about the flushing performance of a specific toilet, use the Maximum Performance (MaP) Test at the Alliance For Water Efficiency website.Most major hardware and houseware stores label their selection of toilets with a numerical score based on their flush performance, taking into account waste removal power and clog resistance.\",\n",
       "  \"Check out the toilet's gallons used per flush. Current toilet models use 1.6 gallons per flush (GPF), which is about half the amount of water used by older toilets. Toilets with a Water Sense label use just 1.28 GPF and received approval as a high-efficiency toilet (HET) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). More information about the WaterSense Program is available at the EPA's website.\",\n",

One-piece models are designed so the tank and the bowl are integrated into a compact unit, making them easy to clean and ideal for smaller bathrooms where you need to save space. However, these models can be more expensive than the standard two-piece model. Two-piece toilet models are the more traditional design of a separate bowl and tank. They are more affordable than one-piece models, and are cheaper to install. However, they take up more space and are more difficult to clean.',\n",

Comfort Height toilets meet the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), making them ideal for seniors and those with a disability.\",\n",
       "  'Always buy a toilet with the correct rough-in. This is the distance between the outlet pipe for the toilet and the wall behind the toilet. Toilet models are available in various sizes to fit different rough-ins, so choosing the right size is crucial. To determine the size of your toilet rough-in, measure from the wall behind the toilet to the bolt caps of your current toilet. Do not include baseboards in your measurements.Most toilets are available in a 12-inch rough-in, which is the standard distance, but a 10- or 14-inch rough-in may be needed in some homes.',\n",

       " 'How to Prevent MRSA Infection': [\"Know how it spreads. MRSA is usually spread to patients in hospital settings by other human hands - usually those of a healthcare professional who has touched someone with the infection. Since hospital patients frequently have weakened immune systems, they are particularly susceptible to getting an infection. While this is by far the most common way that MRSA gets spread, it's also possible to contract it in other ways.For instance: MRSA can be spread when someone touches a contaminated object, like hospital equipment. MRSA can be spread between people who use each other's personal items, like towels and razors. MRSA can be spread between people who use the same equipment, like sports equipment and showers in athletes' locker rooms.\",\n",
       "  \"Understand why it's dangerous. MRSA is actually carried by 30% of healthy people without them even knowing it.It lives inside the human nose, and often doesn't cause a problem, or leads to only minor infections. However, when it does take hold over a weakened immune system, MRSA does not respond to most antibiotics. This makes it very difficult to contain once the infection has begun to have negative effects. MRSA can cause pneumonia, boils, abscesses, and infections of the skin. It can also get into the bloodstream and lead to serious health problems.\",\n",
       "  \"Know who's at risk. People in hospitals - especially those who have had a surgical procedure of some kind, which leaves their bodies prone to getting an infection - have been at risk of getting MRSA for decades. Hospitals and other medical facilities now have protocols in place to decrease the risk of patients getting MRSA, but it is still a problem. A new strain of MRSA now affects healthy people outside of hospitals - especially in school locker rooms, where children tend to share equipment.\",\n",
       "  \"Be a part of your healthcare team.If you're a patient in a hospital, don't leave it all up to the medical personnel to take all the right precautions. Even people doing their best to keep their patients safe make mistakes every once in a while, which is why it's important for you to take the initiative to control your own environment. Here's how to do it: Hospital staff should always wash their hands or use hand sanitizer before touching you. If someone is about to touch you without first taking this precaution, ask them to wash and use hand sanitizer. Don't be afraid to speak up for yourself. Make sure that your IV tubes and catheters are inserted under sterile conditions - that is, that the person inserting them wears a mask and sterilizes your skin beforehand. Places where the skin is pierced are prime entry points for MRSA. If the conditions of your room or the equipment being used seem unsanitary, alert hospital staff. Always ask visitors to wash their hands, and ask people who aren't feeling well to visit another time, when they're better.\",\n",
       "  'Maintain good hygiene. Keep germs off your hands by washing them with soap and warm water or using a hand sanitizer containing at least 62% alcohol. When washing hands, scrub them briskly for 15 seconds and dry them with a paper towel. Use a separate paper towel to turn off the faucet.Be especially careful to wash your hands frequently in healthcare facilities, schools, and other public places. Teach your children to wash their hands correctly.',\n",
       "  \"Be proactive. If you are being treated for a skin infection, ask your doctor if you should be tested for MRSA. Otherwise, he or she may prescribe medications that don't work on antibiotic-resistant staph, which may delay treatment and create more resistant germs. Getting tested may bring you closer to getting the antibiotic you need to treat your infection. A general willingness to speak up in healthcare facilities is important when it comes to protecting yourself from MRSA. Don't assume that your doctor knows what's best.\",\n",
       "  \"Use antibiotics properly. Take all of the prescribed doses of an antibiotic, even if your infection is healing. Don't stop unless your doctor tells you to. Improper antibiotic use contributes to the bacteria's ability to resist the medicine causing them to morph against antibiotics that have the same composition as Methicillin. That's why strict adherence to antibiotic schedule, even if you're well, is advised. Throw away antibiotics after you have used them. Don't use antibiotics that were used by someone else or share your antibiotics with others. If you've been taking an antibiotic for a few days and your infection has not improved, consult your doctor.\",\n",

Sometimes, when you're outside working, it's just not possible or practical to spit into a hanky. If this is the case, walk a few paces away from where you're working and spit off the beaten path.

However, if most of the people on both sides of your family are short, then odds are that you'll be short, too. Don't be discouraged, though. The truth is that you can't know how tall you'll be until you reach full physical adulthood in your mid-twenties. Calculate your projected height. Working in inches or centimeters, you can try to predict your height based on the height of your parents. Add up your mom and dad's heights (in inches or cm). Add 5 inches (13 cm) if you're a boy; subtract 5 inches (13 cm) if you're a girl. Divide by 2. The answer is your predicted height, give or take 4 inches (10 cm).

The human growth hormone (HGH) is produced naturally in our bodies, especially during deep or slow wave sleep. Getting good, sound sleep will encourage the production of HGH, which is created in the pituitary gland.

This position may prove to be uncomfortable for the first few nights, but your body will soon become accustomed to this manner of sleeping and before long you will discover not only extra inches, but also a more comfortable sleep. Kick the 'pillow habit'. This is a very common mistake made by most of us because we are led to believe that a pillow allows for a more comfortable night's sleep so, through habit, we become attached and generally accept this as the most comfortable way to sleep. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The use of a pillow is an incorrect form of sleeping and should be avoided. While lying on your back with your head resting on a pillow, your neck is bent forward in a very unnatural position. In this position, your head is being pushed forward and your back is arched, also a very unnatural position. If you suffer from frequent neck or back pains, in the majority of cases you can probably blame in your pillow or mattress. Make sure your mattress is firm and capable of giving your body full support. This is aid to in keeping you spine as straight as possible while sleeping.

Here are some specific suggestions: Make sure to take in an abundance of carbohydrates and calories for that is where the body gains its energy to grow. Get plenty of calcium (found in dairy products and green vegetables). Calcium promotes bone growth and can help prevent osteoporosis. Taking 500 mg of niacin has shown to significantly increase growth hormone levels only when taken on an empty stomach. Get sufficient vitamin D (which can be obtained through eating fish, alfalfa, or mushrooms, or spending enough time in the sun). Vitamin D promotes bone and muscle growth in children, and a deficiency has been shown to stunt growth and cause weight gain in teenage girls. If you don't like fish, consider a purified fish oil supplement (purifying removes mercury). Take in a lots of lean protein (from meat, cheese, eggs, beans, tofu, seeds, or legumes). Proteins provide an essential building block your body needs in order to grow. At least one (preferably two) of your meals each day should include a high-quality protein. If you think that the amount of protein in your diet is low then take protein powder once or twice a day. Up your zinc intake (oysters, chocolate, peanuts, eggs, peas, asparagus, and supplements). A zinc deficiency can cause stunted growth in children . The best way to make sure you meet your body's daily need is by taking a vitamin or supplement that includes zinc. Eat on a regular schedule. You should be eating 3 meals a day, with small snacks between breakfast and lunch, and lunch and dinner. Try to schedule these events at roughly the same time each day. 4-5 hours is the time needed for insulin to disappear from your bloodstream so that growth hormone can work on building your tissue. This is the period of time that you should wait between meals. Proteins, which are absorbed slowly, should keep you from becoming hungry. Your last meal should be 3-4 hours before you go to sleep. Small amount of protein shake are allowed right before your bedtime. Eat a steady amount of food. That's why dieting is not recommended as long as you're still growing. Not eating a good quantity of food will deprive your body of the substances detailed above, therefore stunting your growth. If you want to lose weight, decrease the amount of fats, sugar, and carbohydrates from your alimentation , but eat the rest of the foods in good, moderate amounts.

So when you stand up and sit up straighter, not only will you look taller, but you will feel taller, and maybe even be taller. Try the Alexander technique for better posture.

If you come from a tall family and you're not growing by your mid-teens, or if your height hasn't changed much from before puberty to during puberty, then it's a good idea to see a doctor. Conditions that can stunt your growth (such as human growth hormone deficiency or autoimmune diseases) are fairly rare, but they do exist. If you're eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of rest, but you're still not growing, then it's time to consult a doctor. Consider seeing a doctor, if you're a short adult. Though there are several childhood conditions (such as rickets) that can result in a short height as an adult, you should still ask a doctor about it. There may be ways to make sure that your bones and organs are healthy, even though you didn't grow to your full height.\"],\n",

UV light is a better purification system because it is also effective against chlorine-resistant microorganisms that may not be cleared by the municipal water system. Using UV is easy to use, extremely effective (kills 99.9% of microorganisms), and produces no harmful by-products.UV light is most effective in clear water where the light waves can penetrate into the water, killing all of the microbes. An at-home UV system is easy to use because it connects directly to the water pipes of your home. It purifies the water as it flows through your faucets.',\n",
       "  'Choose a device for your home. The type of purification system you choose to install is dependent upon the needs of your house. The main things to consider when choosing a system are the quality and flow rate of the incoming water. You also need to consider whether you want just one faucet purified or the whole house.If the flow rate of the incoming water is too fast, the water will not be properly sterilized. The water must be clear for UV to work effectively, so choose a system that combines a filter with the UV purification. Housing of the device should be made of stainless steel to protect electronics from corrosion. Choose a system that has an audible alarm to alert you when the light needs changed or if the system is failing.',\n",
       "  'Install the purification system. Whichever system you choose, install the purification device according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The system will either be attached directly to the pipes near a single faucet in your house or will be attached to the main pipe that brings water into your home. Alternatively, you can have someone come in and install it themselves. If you are unsure about how to do it, ask for help or a demonstration to make sure it is done properly. Install the system in a location that is close to the water faucet. UV light is only effective for the water that passes through it. If that water then carries on through the contaminated pipes, it will become contaminated again. Installing it close to the source and occasionally cleaning your pipes prevents this from happening.The water flows directly through the purification system, so you don’t need to worry about doing anything once the device is installed.',\n",
       "  'Maintain your UV system. The UV lamp is the most essential part of the system. UV lamps do not burn out, but over time they lose intensity. As a general rule, the lamp will need to be replaced about once a year. If you have a system with an alarm, it will alert you when it is time to replace the bulb. It is also recommended to clean the glass around the lamp that may have collected mineral deposits.If the lamp intensity decreases too much, it will no longer be effective against microorganisms and your water will not be sterilized. You can use a UV light intensity meter to determine when your lamp needs to be replaced. Anything that will obstruct the light from reaching the water will decrease the effectiveness of your system.'],\n",

The bottle should be no larger than two liters.PET is a very common plastic used in the manufacture of most soft drink and water bottles. The bottle should not be colored at all.',\n",
       "  'Filter the water. In order to sanitize the water with UV from the sun, the water itself must be clear. If there is any sediment in it, the UV will be less effective. Place a cloth over the top of the bottle and pour the water through the cloth. This will capture any sediment and make the water clear.This filtering step will not sterilize or purify your water, it will just remove the solid particles that may be suspended in the water.',\n",
       "  'Lay the bottle in the sun for at least six hours. The sun emits UV rays and therefore can be used for sanitization. The absolute minimum amount of time required for sterilization is six hours. This is the minimum for a bright, sunny day. Most microorganisms will be killed in this amount of time with the exception being cryptosporidium (10 hours is recommended). If the sky is partly cloudy or half-filled with clouds it can take up to two days for sterilization to be complete.Make sure the bottle is on its side and not standing upright.

It's also smart to avoid sharing towels, washcloths, razors or clothes with other patients while you're recovering in the hospital. If you or any surrounding patients are coughing, then wear a surgical mask to reduce the risk of infection. Viruses and bacteria can travel relatively far distances within droplets of saliva and mucous. The primary bacteria to be concerned with while you're recovering in a hospital are drug-resistant MRSA bacteria and Clostridium difficile (causes severe diarrhea).MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria because they are resistant to most antibiotics.MRSA bacteria developed many years ago due to over-use of antibiotics within hospitals.\",\n",

Sleeping soundly for between seven to nine hours a night on a regular basis is important for healing and getting well, especially while in the potentially stressful hospital environment.Getting the appropriate quality and quantity of sleep positively impacts your mood, behavior, mental functions, immune system and healing ability. While in the hospital, try to keep a regular schedule and don't nap too long in the afternoon (less than 45 minutes). To stimulate a deep sleep, you need your environment quiet, dark and relatively cool. In a busy hospital, you may need to wear ear plugs and a comfortable sleeping mask over your eyes.

After you get out of the hospital, continue to follow any special dietary guidelines that your doctor or surgeon have given you. You may benefit from including whole grains, lean meat, poultry and fish, low-fat dairy and lots of fresh produce (fruits and veggies). These foods will keep your immune system strong and allow your body to repair injured tissues.Fresh berries, in particular, are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. Due to illness and/or reaction to medication, you may lose your appetite or feel nauseous, but it's important to get nutritious food in your body. Let the hospital staff know if you lose your appetite or if you feel nauseous. If you're unable to chew your food very well, either blend it or consider taking some digestives enzymes just prior to meal times. After you go home, avoid food that hampers your body's ability to heal itself, such as refined carbohydrates / sugars (soda pop, candy, ice cream, milk chocolate), artificial sugars (aspartame), trans fats and various preservatives.

When your mucus membranes get dry, they are more susceptible to irritation, inflammation and infection.As such, keep yourself well hydrated by drinking at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of purified water daily while in the hospital — it'll keep your mucus membranes moist and give you a little more energy. Avoid drinking caffeine-rich items, such as coffee, black tea, colas and energy drinks. Caffeine is a diuretic and triggers more urination, which can lead to dehydration.\",\n",

Use a cane or other support if you need to. If you have to spend lots of time in a hospital bed, ask for special pads that help prevent bedsores and \"pneumatic\" stockings that help prevent blood clots. For every day you spend in a hospital bed, it may require 4-5 days of movement after you leave the hospital to fully recover.So get moving before you leave the hospital, if possible. You may also need to do some physical therapy while you are still in the hospital and possibly after you are discharged as well.',\n",

It may seem strange that people should actively make the decision to get well, but many people have negative subconscious thoughts that can reduce the healing process.People can fall into a victim mentality, feel guilty for surviving and/or actually enjoy the attention from being ill, at least unconsciously, which gives their body mixed messages. As such, make the conscious decision that you truly want to get well and recover from your disease or condition. Focusing on not wanting to be sick, rather than getting well, is not as powerful in convincing your mind / body to heal. Use visualization to picture how your body might be killing off an infection or defeating cancer. Whisper to yourself in positive words how you want to get well quickly and be healthy throughout your time in the hospital.',\n",

But those statistics are just a guideline and don’t have to be predictive of how you get well, heal or survive. As such, strive to be the exception and not the mean (average) of the stats. For example, if your doctor says one week is the average time to get well from your condition, then use positive thoughts and optimism to get that down to five days.Doctors used to avoid negatively framing medical information and instead gave \"false\" hope in order to capitalize on optimism, but fear of medical malpractice and litigation has changed that for the most part. If you get bad news or a bleak outlook, it is important to balance hopefulness with realistic expectations. Ask lots of questions and find out as much as you can about your treatment options.',\n",

Stick with filtered water and natural fruit/veggie juices.\",\n",
       "  \"Maintain healthy blood pressure. As noted above, high blood pressure is damaging to blood vessels throughout the body, including the small arteries within the kidneys that are so important for its filtrating ability. As such, keep your blood pressure at a target set by your doctor, which is typically less than 140/90 mm Hg.Blood pressure below this level can help delay or prevent kidney dysfunction and failure. Check your blood pressure regularly, either at your local pharmacy, health clinic, or at home with some purchased equipment. Hypertension often has no obvious symptoms, so you need to keep on eye on your numbers. Eating a low-salt diet, reducing stress and maintaining a healthy weight all help maintain normal blood pressure. If lifestyle changes don't make a big impact, then blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors and ARBs may be able to protect your kidneys by reducing your blood pressure.\",\n",
       "  \"Get regular exercise. In addition to watching your calories, getting regular cardiovascular exercise is a great way to maintain your weight, which fosters kidney health. Obesity strains the heart and blood vessels, which leads to higher blood pressure and eventual kidney damage.. Just 30 minutes of mild-to-moderate cardiovascular exercise on a daily basis is associated with better kidney health as it can reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels, as well as trigger weight loss. Start by simply walking around your neighborhood (if it's safe), then transition to more challenging terrain with some hills. Treadmills and cycling are also great for cardiovascular exercise. Avoid vigorous exercise to start with, especially if you've been diagnosed with a heart issue. Vigorous exercise (such as long-distance running) temporarily increases blood pressure, which strains the kidneys and heart. Thirty minutes of exercise five times a week is a good start, and an hour is even better (for most people), but much more time spent exercising doesn't appear to be significantly more beneficial.\",\n",
       "  'Eat lots of fresh fruits and veggies. A healthy, low-salt diet is healthy for the kidneys because it keeps blood pressure in check. For the most part, fresh fruits and veggies are low in sodium, high in vitamins and minerals, and a good source of antioxidants, which is all beneficial for the cardiovascular system and the kidneys.Fruits and veggies are also good sources of water, which the kidneys need to properly filtrate the blood. Veggies that contain moderate amounts of sodium include artichokes, beets, carrots, seaweed, turnips and celery — so go easy on these. Fruits that have a little more sodium than average include tropical mammy apples, guavas and passion fruits. Canned and pickled vegetables are usually high in sodium and should be avoided or minimized in your diet. Fruits and veggies especially rich in antioxidants include: all dark-colored berries, strawberries, apples, cherries, artichokes, kidney and pinto beans.',\n",
       "  \"Consider taking helpful supplements. The standard American diet is not only too high in sodium, but it's usually deficient in a variety of essential nutrients (certain vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids). Eating a nutritious diet certainly reduces the risk of experiencing any nutritional deficiencies, but supplementing can be beneficial and make up for any gaps in your diet. Supplements that have demonstrated to be beneficial to kidney health in studies include vitamin D, potassium, coenzyme Q10 and omega-3 fatty acids.Clinical trials conducted on chronic kidney disease patients concluded that vitamin D supplements improved kidney and heart function.Remember that our skin can make vitamin D in response to intense summer sunshine. The sodium-potassium balance in the kidneys is crucial for proper function, so adding more potassium to your diet (via foods or supplements) helps to reduce the negative effects of high sodium levels.Coenzyme Q10 helps normalize blood pressure and decrease hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, both strong risk factors for kidney disease.Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation helps to decrease the prevalence of chronic kidney disease by reducing blood pressure and excess protein in the urine.\",\n",
       "  \"Cut back on drinking alcohol. It's no secret that over-indulging in alcoholic beverages (which contain ethanol, a carcinogen) is strongly associated with numerous types of cancer and organ damage, including the kidneys.Ethanol damages the delicate internal structures of the kidneys, making them less able to filter your blood and balance fluids / electrolytes — frequently leading to high blood pressure. Binge drinking (about 4-5 drinks within a couple of hours) can raise blood alcohol levels to the point that the kidneys essentially shut down — a condition called acute kidney injury.As such, either stop drinking alcohol entirely or limit your consumption to no more than 1 alcoholic beverage per day. The least harmful alcoholic beverage is considered to be red wine because it contains antioxidants, such as resveratrol, which can help prevent free radical damage of blood vessels and other tissues.\",\n",
       "  \"Don't overdo it on medications. All medications are toxic to organs such as the liver and kidneys at least to some extent (dosage is obviously an important factor too), but some are much more damaging than others. For example, common over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin are well known to cause kidney damage if they are taken regularly over a prolonged period of time.The byproducts of their breakdown within the body can easily damage the kidneys and liver. If your kidneys are otherwise healthy, then occasional use of these medicines for inflammation and pain control is probably fine, but keep continuous use to less than 2 weeks and dosages under 800 mg daily. If you're taking anti-inflammatories on a long-term basis for arthritis or other chronic conditions, ask your doctor about monitoring your kidney function via certain blood and urine tests.\",\n",
       "  \"Intake less salt. The typical American diet is relatively high in salt, which is comprised of sodium and chloride. Too much sodium inhibits your kidneys from filtering and excreting water, which builds up in the body and increases blood pressure.High blood pressure (hypertension) creates turbulence within the kidney's small blood vessels, which leads to damage and dysfunction. As such, avoid high-sodium foods and stop using the salt shaker during meals. You should consume no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day if your kidneys are healthy, and less than 1,500 mg if you have kidney dysfunction or high blood pressure.Avoid or limit consumption of foods high in sodium, such as: processed meats, crackers, salted nuts and snacks, canned soups, pickled foods, frozen foods and most processed condiments and dressings.Consider adopting some form of DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet that's based on low sodium foods, such as fresh fruits and veggies.\",\n",
       "  \"Monitor your protein consumption. Protein is obviously an essential macronutrient needed to build muscle tissue, skin, enzymes and many other compounds in the body. However, high-protein diets tend to be hard on the kidneys because they must work harder to filter all the protein and amino acids out of the bloodstream.Furthermore, high-protein diets may worsen kidney function in people with kidney disease because their bodies often have trouble eliminating the waste products of protein metabolism.The amount of dietary protein that's healthy for you and your kidneys depends on your body size, muscle mass and activity levels. Men need more protein than women, and athletes need more than people who are sedentary. In general, the average-sized adult needs between 46 to 56 g of protein daily, depending on their weight, muscle mass and overall health.Healthy sources of protein include beans, most soy products, unsalted nuts, hemp seeds, fish, skinless poultry.\"],\n",
       " 'How to Lower TSH Levels Fast1': ['Ask your doctor for a prescription for antithyroid medications. The fastest way to lower your TSH levels due to hyperthyroidism is to take antithyroid drugs like propylthiouracil and methimazole. These drugs are available by prescription from your doctor. They partially block the production of the thyroid hormone and lower your TSH levels. However, it will take six to twelve weeks for the drugs to take full effect.Your doctor may also recommend antithyroid medications to lower your TSH levels so you can take radioactive iodine to reduce your TSH levels further. You may be given radioactive iodine later and taken off the antithyroid medication.',\n",
       "  'Learn the side effects of these medications. Antithyroid medications can cause serious damage to your liver and lead to a low white blood cell count. If you are allergic to these medications, you may experience symptoms like skin rashes, hives, fever, and joint pain.If you experience any of these symptoms, stop taking the medication and speak to your doctor immediately. Have your doctor confirm you are not allergic to antithyroid medications before you take them.',\n",
       "  'Monitor your progress on these medications. Have regular check ins with your doctor to confirm your TSH levels are going down with the help of the medication. It may take one to two years for your TSH levels to go down completely while on the medication.Your doctor may also suggest that you try other treatments like radioactive iodine or thyroid surgery if your TSH levels do not go down with the medication.',\n",
       "  \"Take the medication for 18 to 24 months. You may experience remission after taking antithyroid medication for 18 to 24 months in a row. Some people experience remission within six months of taking the medication.Always follow your doctor's instructions on dosage of the antithyroid medication. Do not take more than instructed.\"],\n",
       " 'How to Know if You Have Spondylosis2': ['Stay healthy and maintain a healthy weight.Eating right and maintaining a healthy weight are two easy things you can do to reduce your chances of developing spondylosis and minimize the impact of the condition once it has developed. Try to get at least one hour of exercise each day. Do light exercise that does not twist or negatively impact your back, such as gentle yoga. Avoid contact sports like football, hockey, and rugby. You should also avoid lifting heavy weights. Instead, go for run, walk, or bike ride. Eat a healthy diet composed primarily of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, with a small amount of lean protein. Avoid eating meat, fast food, and processed foods, which are heavy in sugar, salt, and fat. Drink at least eight glasses of water each day and avoid soda and sweet drinks. Do not smoke. Smoking could increase your neck pain.If you already smoke, invest in nicotine patches or gum to reduce your cravings. Cut your cigarette intake down gradually. For instance, smoke half a pack instead of a full pack each day for a couple weeks. Then cut down to one pack every three days for two more weeks. Continue to reduce your cigarette consumption in this way until it reaches zero.',\n",
       "  'Find a less physical job.If you have a job that puts a lot of wear and tear on your back, try to find another line of work that is less physically challenging. Bending, twisting, and straining your back can increase your chances of developing spondylosis down the line. If possible, try to find another job with the same company you work for now. For instance, move to a desk job instead of doing unpacking, lifting, and similarly physical work. Even desk jobs, however, can have their own risks. Sitting all day in one position with your neck craned toward a computer can lead to neck and back pain, too. Ensure your chair provides an adequate amount of back support. Adjust your position frequently to avoid developing cramps and pain in your back and neck. Walk about the office – even just a short distance -- every 30 minutes or so.',\n",
       "  'Manage prior medical conditions. There are a number of medical procedures that can increase your chances for developing spondylosis later. Arthritis, a ruptured or slipped disk, fractures due to osteoporosis could all increase your risk for spondylosis. Talk to your doctor about treatment for these and related conditions, especially those related to neck or back injuries.Follow your treatment plan in order to avoid developing or worsening spondylosis.'],\n",
       " 'How to Know if You Have Spondylosis3': ['Make a list of symptoms.When you begin noticing the symptoms of spondylosis, write them down, including the day, time, length of the symptom, and the activity that brought the symptom about. Your doctor can use this information to better understand your medical history and develop a treatment plan for you. In addition to a list of symptoms, get information about your family’s medical history. Spondylosis may be inherited, so if others in your family have a history of spondylosis or other back troubles, your doctor might use this to make a diagnosis.',\n",
       "  'See a doctor.If you have any symptom of spondylosis, it may or may not indicate the actual presence of spondylosis. However, even if you do not have spondylosis, it is important to get these conditions checked out by a medical professional, since they could indicate another, equally serious condition. Many people with spondylosis experience no symptoms at all. It is important to get regular health checkups, especially after the age of 60, when most people show some signs of spondylosis in x-rays and medical examinations.Let your doctor know of any medications you’re taking as well.',\n",
       "  'Get a neck compression test.A neck compression test, or Spurling test, can be done to figure out whether or not spondylosis is accompanied by a bulging disc. The doctor will ask you to simply extend your neck and laterally flex and rotate it to the side. This will show your doctor if there is bulging in your neck, or what kind of pain response you get when performing this simple movement.',\n",
       "  'Test for the Hoffman reflex. The Hoffman reflex is a reflex response test. Doctors perform the test to identify a number of illnesses, including multiple sclerosis, spondylosis, and ALS.The Hoffman reflex is tested by pulling your fingers into a tight fist, then flicking the thumb, middle, and index finger. Your doctor will place your hand at rest and then stabilize it between his index and middle fingers. Then he will pinch or flick your middle or ring finger, and watch for contraction of your index finger and thumb. If your reflexes show an incomplete contraction, it may indicate spondylosis.',\n",
       "  'Get a neck x-ray.X-rays are black-and-white images that can reveal neck abnormalities. A neck x-ray can detect bone spurs, disc injuries, fractures, osteoporosis, and wear on the spine, all of which are indicative of spondylosis. Neck x-rays can also identify other changes that occur in the spine, and can rule out other conditions that are similar to spondylosis. This test is done in the hospital’s radiology department by a radiologist. A neck x-ray can help evaluate neck injuries, numbness and pain.',\n",
       "  \"Have an MRI (magnetic resonance image) doneMRIs produce 3D images of your neck and spine. In this test, magnetic fields and radio waves produce detailed cross-sectional image of the bone and tissues. An MRI or CT scan is usually indicated if there is no improvement with medications, education, and physical therapy after a number of weeks or if there is a sudden increase in pain or other symptoms. MRIs can identify areas where nerves may be pinched. Don't eat for 4 hours before the MRI scan. Remove metal objects from your body, because MRI scanners produce strong magnetic fields. An MRI scanner looks like a short cylinder that is open at both ends. You will enter the scanner either head first or feet first. Sometimes a frame is placed over your body to pick up signals sent out by the body to create a better quality image. Be sure to be still during the scan to produce a quality image.\",\n",
       "  'Look into getting a CT scan.A computer tomography (CT) scan is a diagnostic procedure that can determine if you have spondylosis. A CT scan uses x-rays from multiple directions in order to produce a cross-sectional view of the neck. These scans are used to better understand the condition of your bones. Before a CT scan, you must remove all your jewelry and wear a hospital gown. The CT scan is done while you are lying down on a table which moves back and forth while the camera takes a picture. It is important that you remain still during the procedure to produce a good picture.',\n",

When combined with a CT scan or x-ray imaging, doctors can track the movement of the dye to better understand the condition of your spine. Areas where the spine is injured will appear in the myelogram.',\n",
       "  'Look into nerve function tests to assess if your nerves are functioning properly. Nerve function tests can help determine if nerve signals are travelling properly to the muscles. There are two nerve function tests that could help diagnose spondylosis:An electromyogram (EMG) is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity of the nerves while transmitting messages to the muscles. This test is done both when the muscles are contracting and when they are at rest. EMGs can assess the function of the muscles and the nerves. Another type of nerve function test is the nerve conduction study. This test is done by attaching electrodes to the skin above your nerves. A small amount of electricity is passed through the nerve to measure the strength and speed of nerve signals.',\n",

These drugs can help you relieve pain and reduce inflammation in your back and neck.Anti-seizure medications like gabapentin and pregabalin can help reduce your pain. Corticosteroids like prednisone have also been shown to relieve acute pain, and they are usually given for a short period of time due to the side effects. Oral steroids are typical, but in extreme cases your doctor might recommend injection steroids. Muscle relaxants like cyclobenzaprine and methocarbamol might reduce muscle spasms in your back. Over-the-counter medicine like ibuprofen are also useful for pain management.'],\n",
